00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200


00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.280
INTERVIEWER: Today is August 23, 2011.

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.500
I'm Chris Boebel.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.430
As part of the MIT150 Infinite History project, we're talking

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.610
with professor Hal Abelson.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.430
Professor Abelson is the Class of 1922 professor of

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.430
electrical engineering and computer science at MIT.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.140
He holds an AB degree from Princeton University and a PhD

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.860
degree in mathematics from MIT.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.320
In 1992, Abelson was designated as one of MIT's six

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.150
inaugural MacVicar Faculty Fellows.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.259
Professor Abelson is co-director of the

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:35.310
MIT-Microsoft iCampus Research Alliance in educational

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.450
technology.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.130
He's co-chair of the MIT Council on Educational

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.830
Technology.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.820
And he serves on the steering committee

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.705
of the HP-MIT Alliance.

00:00:43.705 --> 00:00:46.950
He has played key roles in fostering MIT institutional

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.690
initiatives such as MIT OpenCourseWare and DSpace.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.600
Hal, thanks very much for taking the time--

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.730
ABELSON: Sure.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.900
INTERVIEWER: --to talk today.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.320
So let's start at the beginning.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.310
ABELSON: The beginning?

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.185
INTERVIEWER: The beginning.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:03.120
Just start by telling me a little bit about where you

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.950
grew up and the early years?

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.470
ABELSON: So the real early years, I grew up on a chicken

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.160
farm in central New Jersey.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.370


00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.120
My parents worked on the farm.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.660
My father later went and worked in the post office.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.810
I was the first one in my family to go to college,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.750
although my parents were always very, very interested

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.300
in education.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.415
My parents liked music, education.

00:01:33.415 --> 00:01:38.220
I had an uncle who sort of was the college person, who worked

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.210
for Exxon and had a high level position there.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.250
So we always cared a lot about education.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.730
I'm not quite sure where I glommed onto math and science.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.730
I remember when I was I guess 12 or 13, I decided I wanted

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.910
to be a physicist, mostly because I

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.590
think I liked the word.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.940
But I didn't know what that was.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.310


00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.500
I did sort of okay in school.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.440
When I talk to kids these days, I remind them that when

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.930
I was their age in seventh or eighth grade, I was getting

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.130
D's in mathematics.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.190
In fact, like a lot of people who end up going into

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.590
computers, we are really bad at doing arithmetic.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.240
Someone once said the reason a lot of people go into

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.950
computers is to make up for their own

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.000
handicaps in doing that.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.060
So I wasn't particularly good in any of those

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.010
subjects early on.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.150
And then about the time I got in high school, I started

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.370
being good at it.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:43.020
One of the things the school did, they hired somebody to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.230
help me learn calculus because of course our school did

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.480
nothing like that.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.460
And I don't know, sort of grew a lot of interest in math and

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.120
science from there.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.640
So at some point I said gee, I don't want to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.470
be a physicist anymore.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.990
I want to be a mathematician because I guess that word

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:01.990
sounded better.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:08.050
And then I got into Princeton on a scholarship, which was

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.970
nice because my family could never have afforded

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.100
anything like that.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.020
And did pretty well at Princeton.

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.840


00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.880
Started getting interested in a subject

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.730
called algebraic topology.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.390
And then got into MIT graduate school on that.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.360
And ended up coming to graduate school at MIT mostly

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.060
because my wife and I were looking for places

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.930
we could both go.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.460
We weren't married then, but she was looking for a place

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.990
where she could go.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:44.700
She got into BU's School of Social Work.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.800
I got into MIT.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.350
MIT also had a draft deferment.

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.310
So back in ancient days, one of the things that you wanted

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.240
to do was if you were worried that getting drafted to go to

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.820
the Vietnam War, so MIT did something where I think

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.430
because I was teaching or something like that, there was

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.930
a category of draft deferment you could get.

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.040
So we ended up coming to MIT.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.280
And MIT was just absolutely an fascinating place.

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.290
One of the nicest things, when I first showed up at MIT, we

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.930
lived in Westgate.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.620
And one of the great memories that we had of being in

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.100
Westgate was looking down over the field and at the other end

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.460
of the field, seeing the tear gas on Mass Ave. Because that

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.080
was the time when even MIT students

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.160
were protesting stuff.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.530
They were protesting, for anybody who remembers, Draper

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:43.370
Labs used to be called the Institute Labs.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.060
And there was a protest about how is it that on the MIT

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.200
campus, there was classified research related to the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.280
Vietnam War?

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.280
It was just sort of wonderful.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.170
Just marvelous to be here and look through this thing.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:59.970
And what do I remember of MIT?

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:05.080
I remember going up to the door on 77 Mass Ave. And gosh,

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.960
they were automatic doors.

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:11.540
And coming from Princeton, which is an ivy covered--

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.690
it's the last thing in the world you would ever

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.260
imagine like that.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.190
And then there were these long, long halls.

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.920
And I always had these visions of getting on roller skates

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.990
and going down the halls these automatic doors.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.370
It was just a wild place.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.350
It was all one building.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.240
I didn't know quite what to make of it.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.580


00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.390
But then early on, it could have been a couple of weeks

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:42.920
after I got here, the Students for a Democratic Society, if

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.730
anyone remembers that from the '60s, that was the campus

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.535
activist organization.

00:05:51.535 --> 00:05:54.690
It took over the President's Office.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.560
And they did this great thing.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.440
They had open house at the President's Office.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:03.090
And they were sitting there replaying the tapes so they

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.050
could see what was typed on the electric typewriters in

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.870
President Howard Johnson's office.

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.670
And they held open house.

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.830
And I said, hey, I'm a new graduate student.

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.100
I'm never in my life, ever going to be able to walk into

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:16.690
the MIT's President's Office.

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.270
So let me go sit around and see what's in

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:20.930
the President's Office.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:21.830
So we walk in.

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.390
And there were a bunch of students kind of sitting on

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.170
the floor of the President's Office.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:35.140
And I see a guy that I'd been to high school with, who I

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.820
knew had gone to MIT, but we'd had no contact since then.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.195
And I went up to him and said hi.

00:06:41.195 --> 00:06:43.440
Gee, hi, Ronnie.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.240
This is sort of really nice.

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.440
And he says, what are you doing?

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.970
And I said, I'm a new graduate student.

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:49.970
I'm looking for what to do.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.880
What's interesting to do around here?

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.300
And he said, oh, why don't you go over to the Artificial

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.190
Intelligence Lab.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.840
I hear they're doing interesting stuff.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.760
So I wandered over there and talked to some people.

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.920
And that's essentially how I got into computer science and

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.290
AI and all the stuff I'm doing now.

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.510
And I like to tell that story to students who worry about

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.350
what they're going to do when they grow up.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.650
Because I like to tell them it will be random,

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:18.630
and you have no idea.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.010
But at some point, some totally random thing will

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.730
happen that will have a tremendous influence.

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:25.420
So don't worry about it too much.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:29.190
INTERVIEWER: So backing up for just a moment, had you done

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.060
work in computer science before that at Princeton, or

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:32.650
even previously?

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.040
How did you first--

00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:33.750
ABELSON: Yeah.

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.640
At Princeton I did--

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.492
well, there sort of wasn't a computer science major then.

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:40.230
In fact, I'm not even sure there was one at MIT

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:42.040
when I showed up.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:45.720
But at Princeton, a bunch of us worked in

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.450
the computer center.

00:07:48.450 --> 00:07:53.905
And the Princeton Computer Center had an IBM--

00:07:53.905 --> 00:07:56.110
I think a 7.090 or 7.10.

00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:59.880
It got one of the first 3.60s.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.030
And they were working on this very weird

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:07.630
thing called time sharing.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:12.250
And a bunch of us went around and messed around with that

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:18.080
and did what most of Princeton considered to be a totally

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.950
worthless, stupid thing with computers, which is actually

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.790
using it for text processing.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.010
Because everyone knew that what computers were really for

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.940
were solving big complicated equations.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:34.460
And the computer center used to take down the system a

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.500
couple of hours each week and let those of us who wanted to

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:41.700
screw around and waste time, play with this

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:42.490
text editing thing.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:45.570
Get tremendous complaints from the astrophysics department

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:46.760
because people had to stop trying to

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.480
solve on science equations.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.720
So I became one of the people who were

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.810
messing around with that.

00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:53.710
And I became a little bit of a consultant, an undergraduate

00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:57.940
consultant in the computer system, teaching people to

00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:04.450
migrate their programs from FORTRAN to a language that IBM

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.540
and a couple of other places were pushing then called PL/1,

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.980
a very modest name, Programming Language 1.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.020
And this was supposed to be the be all and end all of the

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:15.840
new computer stuff.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.610
And there was a big move to say you should translate all

00:09:19.610 --> 00:09:20.680
your programs into PL/1.

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:25.130
So I became one of what was called the PL/1 kids and would

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:29.680
consult with faculty in the other departments about how to

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:31.650
modify their programs.

00:09:31.650 --> 00:09:33.920
So I had some stuff in computing and

00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.940
I knew about that.

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.610
I knew very little about what I actually went into at MIT.

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.360
But it was a background in computers, enough to walk into

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.600
the AI Lab and do interesting things.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:50.030
INTERVIEWER: But at the time you came to MIT, initially

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:52.850
there was not a sense that you would be

00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:53.770
moving in that direction?

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:55.660
ABELSON: No, I was in the math department.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:01.880
And I was a graduate student in the math department, became

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:05.130
an instructor in the math department after that, and

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:09.830
only moved into computing later on because some of the

00:10:09.830 --> 00:10:14.540
work I was doing in topology was related

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.020
to distributed computing.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:20.130
And then sort of the topology part of it atrophied and the

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:21.640
computing part of it grew.

00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.110
And eventually when into computer science.

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.540
INTERVIEWER: So you mentioned the AI Lab.

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.810
Talk a bit more about working there and also you worked with

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.150
Seymour Papert in the Logo Lab as well, right?

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.830
ABELSON: Well, that's actually how I started in the AI Lab.

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.420
For some reason I went--

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.170
there was an early Logo presentation called I think

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:48.780
Teaching Children Thinking, which was in 26-100.

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.420
And it was this big thing where Seymour Papert and his

00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.260
assistant for many years, Cynthia Solomon, talked about

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:58.650
the Logo computer language and showed the Logo turtle.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.080
And I looked at it and it was pretty fascinating.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:01.990
And pretty wild.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:06.210
I remember later on reading a report from a journalist who's

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.690
been there.

00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:12.370
And her mind was just blown about this notion that

00:11:12.370 --> 00:11:14.465
children should do these weird robot things.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:16.870
And I remember her saying, I looked at this thing and I

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.730
thought these people were witches.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.590
But anyway, I thought they were cool, whether they were

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:24.760
witches or not.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:28.270
And I walked over to the AI Lab, looking for

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.830
something to do.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.936
And walked into the elevator.

00:11:32.936 --> 00:11:35.070
And then elevator stopped at one of the floors and then

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.660
Seymour got in.

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.050
And I said, hi, I like your stuff.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.660
I'm a new graduate student.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:40.430
Can I work for you?

00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:41.700
And he said, yeah.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.700
And that's how I got into this whole business.

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.695
So another bunch of random events.

00:11:45.695 --> 00:11:49.580


00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:52.710
INTERVIEWER: So you've talked a little bit about what it was

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:56.310
like coming to MIT in the late 1960s, what your impression

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.360
was of the campus.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.410
But give me a little bit more information about sort of the

00:12:02.410 --> 00:12:04.470
culture and the environment at that time.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:08.220
I mean obviously it differed as you've said from Princeton

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.910
and was unlike other things you'd seen.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:12.305
ABELSON: Well to me, it was really strange.

00:12:12.305 --> 00:12:18.400
I mean MIT is such a big complicated place.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.070
I've often thought that well, after being here about 20

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:27.210
years I finally got the ability to think of the place

00:12:27.210 --> 00:12:28.920
as a whole place.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.210
And I just don't even know how it's possible to do that

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.520
because there are just so many things going on and it's so

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.020
complicated.

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.630
But my impression from Princeton is that it was very

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:43.850
strange and very regimented.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:48.780
So I remember hearing about the Experimental Study Group.

00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:53.560
So what people told me about the Experimental Study Group

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.420
was that it was a place where you could learn on your own

00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:57.880
and do stuff that's independently

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.980
and it was very open.

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:02.550
And I remember going over that, because I had some

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:04.360
friends who were in the ESG.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.840
So what do you do here?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.240
What do you do that's independent?

00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.390
And they said something like, well we get to take the

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:12.200
standard course curriculum, but we get

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.760
to study it by ourselves.

00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.670
And I just remember breaking down laughing.

00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:23.030
I said, that's this place's idea of what independent

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.420
learning is?

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.550
Because I'd been in a program at Princeton, a very '60s

00:13:29.550 --> 00:13:32.240
program, I think even Princeton stop doing it, where

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.010
they admitted you.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:38.750
And they said hey, you're a bunch of smart people.

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:41.630
You have no requirements.

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:43.120
You had department requirements.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.570
But the rest of the time, Princeton's a big place, take

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:46.350
what you want.

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.510
And all of the standard things you'd call distribution

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:52.790
requirements or university requirements are just

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.490
abolished for you.

00:13:55.490 --> 00:13:57.010
Some of us totally exploited it.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.870
Some of us had a great time.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:03.100
I ended up with a couple of friends essentially living as

00:14:03.100 --> 00:14:06.590
graduate students in the math department.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:11.830
But coming from there to MIT, it was this sense of being

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:13.915
regimented and precise.

00:14:13.915 --> 00:14:17.600


00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.500
Later I've come to identify that as

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.750
an engineering culture.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.310


00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:28.400
I see the same thing happening at Google, because I've been

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:29.750
spending time at Google.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.280
So you see this culture and you love it.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.710
I mean I just love engineer's culture.

00:14:35.710 --> 00:14:37.960
I'm an engineer and I do that.

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.205
But one of the characteristics of an engineer's culture is

00:14:42.205 --> 00:14:46.300
you sort of sit and you say, what's the problem, what are

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.060
you're trying to do?

00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:50.370
And then about three seconds later you say

00:14:50.370 --> 00:14:52.230
okay, what's the solution?

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:54.960
And you think for about two minutes and you

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.410
figure out the solution.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:00.010
And then you just drive to that solution as fast you can.

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:06.610
And looking back, I recognize that's how I reacted to MIT.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:08.680
So there was no sense that the requirements were

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.650
wrong or any of that.

00:15:10.650 --> 00:15:12.870
It was just we figured out this is the way to do it.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.060
And now we are just going to drive to that as

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.320
effectively as we can.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.360
And MIT's kind of like that.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:21.560
And there are wonderful parts about that.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:25.440
And there are sort of bad part of that.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:26.810
INTERVIEWER: Tell me a bit more about working with

00:15:26.810 --> 00:15:27.290
Seymour Papert.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:28.762
What was that like?

00:15:28.762 --> 00:15:30.790
ABELSON: Well, Seymour was, is amazing.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:35.440
So I guess people know that tragically he was very

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.280
severely injured in Vietnam.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.230
And his brain was very affected.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.860
And he's under rehabilitation now.

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.065
But Seymour was just absolutely amazing--

00:15:45.065 --> 00:15:50.750
I mean his childlike sense of wonder at learning.

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.800
And what Seymour really is about is learning.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.590
So people talk about computing and people talk about math.

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:02.730
But with Seymour you are just surrounded by this joy of

00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:04.870
being able to learn.

00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:06.510
So it's not just math and things.

00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:13.010
It's things like, he taught himself when we were there how

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:14.660
to work on the bongo board.

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.070
There's some old AI Lab historic tapes of Seymour

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:21.590
doing the bongo board.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:27.070
And what he loved was to explain to people how you

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:30.810
thought about how to balance on the bongo board.

00:16:30.810 --> 00:16:32.100
He also did it with juggling.

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.800
So he sort of had a tremendous--

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:37.760
teaching people to juggle.

00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:40.490
And his idea was that you could think about that.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:43.800
There was a method for thinking about how you juggle.

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:48.420
So this thing that looked like a very complicated thing that

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.390
a circus person was doing, it almost magic, you could

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.550
actually teach it.

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:57.080
And everything he did was infused with that.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:00.660
I remember going to visit him in Maine.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:01.710
And he wrote this map.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:05.760
And the map, you could tell that he enjoyed writing the

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.740
directions on this map in a way that people would

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:09.859
understand them.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.540
And of course that went over into math and science.

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.630
So he had exactly the same philosophy that learning about

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.319
math and science isn't magic.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:23.530
There's a deliberate, in his way, procedural way of

00:17:23.530 --> 00:17:25.960
thinking about knowledge and about learning.

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.160


00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:32.340
Another critical part of that is the notion of debugging.

00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.000
So there's this idea that you do something,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.100
and you make a mistake.

00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:39.140
And he would always totally emphasize that

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.560
mistakes are wonderful.

00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.930
Bugs are just great because that allows you to go back and

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.170
analyze and think about stuff.

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:52.430
And all of that influence went not only in my own work in

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:58.270
education, but also in the computer science work that

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.280
Gerry Sussman and I did.

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:05.880
There's this thing called the procedural

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.140
explanation of knowledge.

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.520


00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:16.010
One critical thing in teaching people ideas, whether in

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:19.880
computer science or anything, is to give them names and to

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:21.210
use those names and things.

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.340
And that goes right through all of our work in the Scheme

00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:26.300
programming language and our work in making MIT's first

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.260
computer science course.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:31.210
It goes absolutely, directly back to Seymour.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.870
INTERVIEWER: Were there other key mentors or professors that

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.370
influenced your development, your intellectual or your

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.440
professional development as a graduate student.

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.410
ABELSON: Oh well, sure.

00:18:41.410 --> 00:18:46.220
I mean I wasn't a graduate student in computer science.

00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:52.690
I didn't work for Seymour as a research instructor.

00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:55.540
My research was actually in mathematics under Dennis

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.710
Sullivan, who is a very, very famous topologist, who was in

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.380
the math department at MIT in those days.

00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:04.420
And again, he was a little bit different.

00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:06.460
Dennis was one of these

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:09.450
mathematicians who's just magic.

00:19:09.450 --> 00:19:12.100
You look at this thing and you say how could this guy

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.290
possibly have ever thought about this stuff?

00:19:15.290 --> 00:19:19.200
And he was just an enormous influence about--

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:24.550
just sort of this intellectual excellence where the stuff

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:26.640
springs from nowhere.

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:30.580
And you're just inspired that way.

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:33.210
INTERVIEWER: So tell me a little bit more about your

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:36.790
professional path from mathematics to computer

00:19:36.790 --> 00:19:40.270
science and from getting a PhD at MIT to being a

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.400
professor at MIT?

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.885
ABELSON: Oh, sure.

00:19:42.885 --> 00:19:44.910
Well when I got a PhD, I was in the math

00:19:44.910 --> 00:19:47.960
department doing topology.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.990
Got an appointment as an instructor.

00:19:51.990 --> 00:19:55.280
But then because I was working in Logo, MIT started something

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.490
in the mid-'70s called the Division for Study in Research

00:20:00.490 --> 00:20:03.180
and Education.

00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.910
And it had a couple of key pieces to it.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.590
There were three leaders.

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.460
One was Ben Snyder, who wrote a very famous book at MIT

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.790
called The Hidden Curriculum, which is all about how

00:20:17.790 --> 00:20:22.630
surviving at MIT is a process of constant triage.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:25.100
And students at MIT have to learn that.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.000
One's Don Schon, who was in the Sloan School, who was very

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.820
famous for his theories of knowledge or ideas of espoused

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.320
knowledge and how you do things.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.030
And the third one which was Seymour doing Logo.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:40.125
So I became part of the Division for Study in Research

00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:42.170
and Education.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:47.140
Got a joint appointment in math and DSRE.

00:20:47.140 --> 00:20:51.250
And that's where we sort of really started to do Logo work

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:56.070
as sort of real MIT research kind of stuff.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:57.910
But then eventually what happens, MIT decided

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.270
to close down DSRE.

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:04.730
I was sort of too junior then to understand or even be aware

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:06.930
of the politics behind that.

00:21:06.930 --> 00:21:09.410
But in any case, MIT decided to close it down.

00:21:09.410 --> 00:21:12.110
And then I moved into the electrical engineering

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:16.160
computer science department, kind of on the basis of the

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:19.020
Logo work and the basis of the fact that I was doing

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:20.590
distributed computing.

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.710
And that's sort of where I've been sitting.

00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:28.210
INTERVIEWER: So tell me a bit more about the early Logo work

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:31.710
and your work in distributed computing and how that has

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:35.785
sort of influenced your research path since?

00:21:35.785 --> 00:21:39.750


00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.000
ABELSON: Well, I don't actually think about Logo and

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.650
distributed computing together very much.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:48.810
INTERVIEWER: Well, we can treat it separately I suppose.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.700
ABELSON: Other than they kind of both end up being a vision

00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.100
of computing and being formal about it and things.

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:59.950
The Logo work was as I said, magic.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:04.850
It is really hard right now to go back.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:10.961
We're talking a dozen years before the personal computer.

00:22:10.961 --> 00:22:17.980
What we used to say in Logo is oh my god, if a computer could

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.520
just cost $10,000, that would

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.095
revolutionize all of education.

00:22:24.095 --> 00:22:26.680


00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.870
Because what we were doing is these were million machines, a

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:35.530
million dollars in 1968 dollars.

00:22:35.530 --> 00:22:37.690
They were sitting in the Artificial Intelligence Lab,

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.070
doing the world's very best, fanciest research an

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:43.470
artificial intelligence.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:47.820
And we were hooking them up over phone lines to be used by

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:52.930
sixth graders in Lexington, Massachusetts.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:55.700
And just a totally outrageous thing.

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.220
One my first projects as a graduate student was working

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:03.800
on a remote display that you could hook up that could sit

00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.070
in Lexington and move over a phone line.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.680
And so students could write what was effectively the first

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.720
Logo turtle and draw designs on this graphics display.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.530
So that was like my first job as a graduate student,

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.190
implementing that.

00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:22.060
But it was so off scale.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:28.510
Just the very idea that a computer would be something

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:29.780
that a kid could use.

00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:35.570
We take it so it for granted now that it's almost

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:38.300
impossible to put yourself in that mindset.

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.940
So most people thought we were crazy, because I mean what a

00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:44.440
weird thing.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.810
Why could a computer ever be something that would be

00:23:47.810 --> 00:23:52.030
relevant to a kid, much less programming it or anything?

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.170
And it was a mixture of what happened in the AI Lab.

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.270
Every couple of weeks somebody would run in off the street

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:01.320
saying, I want to see the robots.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.390
You're making robots.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:04.480
I want to come see them.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.780
And AI Lab was just a wonderful mixture of that.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.070
So it was run by Seymour Papert and of course Marvin

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:18.966
Minsky, who are just two completely brilliant people

00:24:18.966 --> 00:24:23.580
with I think a real sense of faith, in that if you're

00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.340
surrounded by a lot of smart people and you give them a lot

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:34.660
of freedom and your job is really to inspire people, it

00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:35.500
will do great things.

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:40.600
And the AI Lab was just infused with that.

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.450
There was just a tremendous sense of community among the

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.740
AI researchers, which was partly true because it was

00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:48.890
pretty small.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:52.570
One of the things that's happened more recently is that

00:24:52.570 --> 00:24:55.530
merged with the Lab for Computer Science.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.790
And it doesn't have that same real sense of community and

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.460
flexibility.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.670
But the original AI Lab, there have been a much of books

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.190
written about it, all sorts of things emerged from that.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:09.760
The other thing that emerged from that, that maybe you want

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.940
to talk about later is Richard Solomon and the whole free

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:17.980
software movement, which these days is better known as the

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:18.950
Open Source Movement.

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:22.280
But that was a thing--

00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.650
I mean in a deep sense it had to do with computer science,

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:25.500
but not obviously.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.360
But it's a whole kind of philosophy that grew out of

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:35.420
this sense that technology is fundamentally a data community

00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:39.630
and fundamentally about a whole bunch of inspired people

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.290
sharing and building on each other's work.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:45.050
And that of course goes way past software into things like

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:48.270
Creative Commons and lots of the stuff that we see now.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.820
But it came out of that germ of sharing around

00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:55.300
a technology community.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.810
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I want to definitely in a little bit

00:25:57.810 --> 00:26:01.930
explore some of these broader ideas in their current form.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:07.520
But let's talk a bit about that culture of sharing and of

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:13.900
open networks within MIT at that point.

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:17.480
I mean I've read that obviously there's a whole sort

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:20.950
of different landscape of security and

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.030
passwords or lack thereof.

00:26:23.030 --> 00:26:27.370
But just describe the environment a bit more at that

00:26:27.370 --> 00:26:30.610
time and how obviously it had effects later.

00:26:30.610 --> 00:26:33.490
ABELSON: Well remember for thinking

00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:35.740
about now, the internet--

00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.770
it wasn't an internet then-- the ARPANET was a small place.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.780
And it really was a very small, very,

00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:45.960
very homogeneous place.

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.080
I like to tell people I've had my email address since I kind

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.230
of knew all of the people that I could have send email to.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.350


00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:58.780
I mean it's been written a lot that people who originally

00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:03.620
designed the internet said they just sort of did not

00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.370
design the internet architecture to think that

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:08.990
there would be bad guys out there.

00:27:08.990 --> 00:27:10.220
Because they knew all the people.

00:27:10.220 --> 00:27:12.220
All the people were like them.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.410
And that reflected over in passwords.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:18.610
I remember there was one sort of dark day when the people

00:27:18.610 --> 00:27:22.150
from ARPA said, you need to put passwords on your accounts

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.920
because they're on the network.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.860
And for security, you need to do that.

00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:32.740
And a whole bunch of us were just convinced this was a

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:33.760
horrible idea.

00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:36.680
I mean what a terrible idea that you'd have to put a

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.260
password in an account and people could get into it.

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.720


00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:47.410
I remember Richard Stallman reacted to this by making his

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.570
password RMS, which was initials.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:57.060
So just jumping ahead a little bit, if you move about 10, 12

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:06.040
years later, my daughter, when she was about oh 14,

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:11.070
introduced me to what became known as MUDS or multiplayer

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.960
games on the internet.

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.320
I had no idea this thing existed.

00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.970
And I was introduced to this by my, what she then, she

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.861
probably was maybe about 13.

00:28:22.861 --> 00:28:28.390
And I come home and she says daddy, do you know there's

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:33.740
this thing on the computer that all kids in the whole

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.740
world can use?

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:38.200
And I say, gosh no.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.180
And she says, I'll show you.

00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:43.770
And she says you have to dial this phone number.

00:28:43.770 --> 00:28:45.820
So she starts dialing this phone number.

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:51.870
And I say, oh my god, that's my lab at MIT.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.480
That's the terminus server to my lab at MIT.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:56.860
And she says yeah, you have this thing.

00:28:56.860 --> 00:29:00.130
And it types out this funny star or something.

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:06.620
And now I'm supposed to type R-M-S. And I say, oh my god,

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:09.150
you're typing Stallman's password to

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.360
get into the system.

00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:12.890
And she goes from that and starts up playing this game.

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:13.390
And it was great.

00:29:13.390 --> 00:29:15.230
She had no idea that this was MIT.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.350
She had no idea what RMS meant.

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:21.490
But there were kids all over the world who were doing this.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:25.380
And that's a little bit of the spirit of sharing and openness

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.600
and delight that comes from that.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.370
That's just really hard to do now.

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:34.520
Because again, the network is a much less homogeneous place

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:35.690
than it used to be.

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:39.910
But that's a little bit of what that AI Lab kind of

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:45.870
spirit I remember, just to give you another little

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.430
anecdote about that, that's fun.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.530
I don't know if you've interviewed Joel Moses?

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.400
INTERVIEWER: Not personally, but yeah.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:57.950
ABELSON: So Joel Moses at that time was the head of the

00:29:57.950 --> 00:30:00.680
symbolic mathematics project.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.380
That's really the great thing that he did, before becoming

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:07.890
provost, sort of inventing symbolic mathematics.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:11.793
And there was a whole big dispute between him and one of

00:30:11.793 --> 00:30:16.270
his ex-students who had gone to Berkeley.

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.690
And there was a dispute about who should get access to this

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.520
Maxima program and should it be licensed and not licensed.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.830
And there was a fairly heated email exchange that went

00:30:25.830 --> 00:30:31.370
between Joel and Rich Fateman.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.080
And of course, everyone could read everybody else's

00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:37.480
email at that time.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:39.900
And they decided that people in the lab were wasting so

00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:44.590
much time reading Joel's email that they simply translated

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:47.330
all of Joel's email to message of the day.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.980
So you all saw it when you logged on.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.260
And that's a little bit again, the sense of playfulness and

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:57.640
openness and we're all part of this big community and the

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:02.220
computer system is a way of empowering that.

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:05.640
And I do believe that had a whole lot to do especially

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.540
with the development of time sharing.

00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:18.280
In a sense sort of Bob Fano and Corby Corbato, when they

00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.210
started the time sharing project, it was sort of about

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:25.080
technology.

00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:28.530
But pretty soon they realized really what they'd done is

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:31.950
create a new kind of community.

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:36.110
And to their credit they recognized that very, very

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:38.870
early and pushed the sense of gee, there's

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:39.970
a thing like community.

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.110
There is an information community.

00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:46.880
MIT was one the first places that really did that in a

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.770
conscious way.

00:31:48.770 --> 00:31:50.700
And again, this all comes out of the same kind

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.820
of culture of openness.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.910
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, we'll return to the whole question

00:31:54.910 --> 00:31:58.090
of open networks, Open Source a bit later.

00:31:58.090 --> 00:32:03.610
I want to turn a little bit in a different direction and ask

00:32:03.610 --> 00:32:08.160
a bit about your interest and professional development of

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:15.910
teaching computer science, of the development of 6.001 and

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:23.370
also your work with Gerald Sussman and the book.

00:32:23.370 --> 00:32:25.380
And maybe, I don't know if this is a productive way of

00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.230
leading into it, but it's a question I'm

00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:29.470
really curious about.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:33.040
You mentioned very early on that when you were growing up,

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:35.815
you were bad at arithmetic, but found out later that you

00:32:35.815 --> 00:32:37.330
were good at math.

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:38.935
And I think that's very fascinating.

00:32:38.935 --> 00:32:43.460


00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:48.480
How does one think about math in a way that makes that true?

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:51.720
I mean they're impossible that could be bad at arithmetic,

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.200
but good at math.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.280
ABELSON: I don't know.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.460
I don't view arithmetic as having very much to do with

00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.870
math in fact.

00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:01.460
And I think there are a lot of people in

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.520
kind of the same boat.

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:08.000
Again, there's theories that people who go into these

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.550
developmental fields are doing it in some sense to make up

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:13.750
for their own deficits, to try them.

00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:18.140
So I sort of view it kind of that way.

00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.500
But again, I've always been interested in puzzling out

00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.940
things and explaining things.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:28.740
I wasn't very much interested in teaching until I, gosh,

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.360
until I got to MIT in fact.

00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:36.080
But it was mostly explaining things to myself.

00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:40.390
Being in a couple of very good summer high school programs,

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:44.980
one at University of Notre Dame, which has since moved to

00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:49.270
Ohio State, which had a long, long, long track record of

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:52.340
inspiring people in mathematics.

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.560
One at Cornell, in physics.

00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:57.810
So that's another kind of educational link that I was

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.360
exposed to.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:06.130
And later, my colleague Andy diSessa and I ran that kind of

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:10.760
summer high school program at MIT around computer science

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.820
and Logo and teaching things.

00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.000
So I've been interested in education kind of from that

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.250
perspective.

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.710


00:34:21.710 --> 00:34:23.590
I've also played around with computers in education.

00:34:23.590 --> 00:34:29.090
One of the things I did in the math department was I was

00:34:29.090 --> 00:34:30.074
teaching linear algebra.

00:34:30.074 --> 00:34:33.130
And I think just for the heck of it, I did what must have

00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:37.070
been one of the very first MIT computer exercises where

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:41.630
students used the Multics computer system in those days

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.460
to do some exercise at the end of the day about matrices.

00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:47.389
Now I didn't know what I was doing.

00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:49.199
And it wasn't particularly good and wasn't particularly

00:34:49.199 --> 00:34:49.780
successful.

00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:53.300
But it was kind of foray into saying, gosh these MIT

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:57.830
computers might actually get used in courses.

00:34:57.830 --> 00:35:01.790
Not much of that happened for a long time after that though.

00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:05.900
INTERVIEWER: Thinking about teaching computer science

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.640
specifically, can you talk a bit about the Structure and

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.080
Interpretation of Computer Programs and what that grew

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.600
out of and what the sort of fundamental concepts are

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.220
behind your approach?

00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:23.160
ABELSON: So Gerry Sussman and I, I think were really

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:29.980
privileged in that we wrote a book that really was able to

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:38.770
draw on that whole of a 20-year history of how MIT and

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:43.890
that whole AI culture thought about computing.

00:35:43.890 --> 00:35:47.710
And it goes directly back to again Seymour Papert and

00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:49.450
Marvin Minsky.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:53.600
And it really has to do with--

00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.500
what's the phrase we used-- a computer program is a way of

00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.400
expressing ideas and communicating ideas, and only

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.600
incidentally about getting a machine to do stuff.

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.400
That is straight out of--

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.290
I don't think Seymour used those words, but that's

00:36:11.290 --> 00:36:14.480
straight out of the Logo philosophy of

00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:15.580
we're teaching you--

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.930
like I talked about juggling before.

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.700
This really is, what's the procedure for how you juggle?

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:26.100
And critical in being able to do that is having the right

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:30.580
set of words and having the right descriptive framework

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:33.310
for saying things like that.

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:39.700
And so the key idea in Structure and Interpretation

00:36:39.700 --> 00:36:43.160
is what we ended up calling the linguistic approach to

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.810
programming design, which says if I would like to do some

00:36:46.810 --> 00:36:53.030
very complicated thing, one of the critical tasks is picking

00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:58.080
the right descriptive framework for saying that.

00:36:58.080 --> 00:37:00.990
So there is a complete blend.

00:37:00.990 --> 00:37:08.560
I think somewhere in that book we wrote that when you make a

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.450
complicated program, you're actually designing a special

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:15.320
purpose computer language to solve a problem.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:19.740
And it comes through in lots and lots of ways.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:25.190
So it goes back I think to the AI culture, which has the

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:27.880
property that you don't quite know what problem you're

00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.000
solving because these things are really complicated.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:37.020
It's not as if someone says compute the total payment on

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:38.610
this mortgage where you know exactly what

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.340
you're going to do.

00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:44.410
Rather it says, you want to be mucking around in this area to

00:37:44.410 --> 00:37:48.200
solve this problem and lots and lots and lots and lots of

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.320
similar problems.

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:56.790
And that permeates both the design of the book and the

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:59.380
actual programming technology that people use.

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:04.620
So the style of programming languages that go back to LISP

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.870
is really sort of muddier.

00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:10.960
It's not a very precise kind of thing.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:13.710


00:38:13.710 --> 00:38:16.710
You make ways of programming things where you're solving

00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:21.270
not just one problem but a whole family

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.780
of problems in that.

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:26.310
And again, it goes back to very, very technical things,

00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:29.970
like LISP is a very good language for creating other

00:38:29.970 --> 00:38:32.070
computer languages.

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:33.760
Because when you're programming in LISP, you

00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:37.250
actually have the mentality of gosh, I'm actually creating

00:38:37.250 --> 00:38:41.510
some special purpose language to solve not just one problem,

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.850
but lots of them.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:46.000
And that's the critical idea in Structure and

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.250
Interpretation.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.940


00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.150
I mean we can't take credit for that.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:57.570
We were just blessed that there was a whole tradition of

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:02.500
20 years of really deep thinking at MIT and a couple

00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:04.060
of other similar places.

00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:07.600
And we sort of got to be the people who got to

00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:09.800
put that in the book.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.830
And it's had enormous influence, but it's not

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:14.840
because of us, it's because the tremendous power of those

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:17.900
ideas and the communities that they came from.

00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.750
INTERVIEWER: So moving beyond those communities that the

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:26.000
book and that thought process came out of, did you encounter

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.680
resistance, maybe that's not the right word, maybe

00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:28.880
misunderstanding--

00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:30.735
people who were focused on the syntax?

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:33.380
ABELSON: So we published this with MIT Press.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:38.280
And MIT Press sent it out for reviews.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.800
And the first review came back.

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:42.670
And I'll never forget.

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:49.840
It said, quote, the question is, is in MIT Press publishing

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:56.090
this book going to advance or set back computer science?

00:39:56.090 --> 00:39:57.890
So there was a lot of resistance to this because

00:39:57.890 --> 00:39:58.780
it's just very different.

00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:02.480
And there's a lot of people who really don't believe in

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.420
that approach, who really do think it's the wrong thing.

00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:10.420
Because again, it's this notion of you don't actually

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:16.620
focus on solving this problem very, very, very precisely.

00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:19.985
There's a whole movement in computer science, a

00:40:19.985 --> 00:40:27.010
tremendously respectable one, and it says a program is like

00:40:27.010 --> 00:40:29.285
the proof of a mathematical theorem.

00:40:29.285 --> 00:40:34.170
And there are people who do prove things about programs.

00:40:34.170 --> 00:40:37.800
That in some sense is the mainstream almost. Whereas

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:40.470
we're saying well, a program is sort of like a language.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.850
Like you can say lots of things.

00:40:41.850 --> 00:40:44.290
And I don't imagine I'm going to prove everything

00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:44.840
I'm going to say.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:47.220
It's just that the great thing is I get to see all these

00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.750
different things.

00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:52.610
So we've had a lot of influence, but I wouldn't even

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:55.040
say that we're mainstream, even now.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:58.930


00:40:58.930 --> 00:41:00.680
INTERVIEWER: From my limited experience when I think back

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:03.070
to my computer programming classes, it was more like the

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:05.150
mathematical theorem approach.

00:41:05.150 --> 00:41:05.570
Yeah.

00:41:05.570 --> 00:41:06.570
ABELSON: Exactly right.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:08.880
It is.

00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:12.790
INTERVIEWER: So talk about 6.001 and the development of

00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.150
that class, which is obviously closely related

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:19.510
to the book, right?

00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:20.100
ABELSON: Gosh.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:25.920
So the other person who really deserves enormous credit for

00:41:25.920 --> 00:41:27.170
this is Bob Fano.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:29.460


00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:34.100
There was a tradition of, what was the first MIT computer

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.830
science course?

00:41:36.830 --> 00:41:38.870
There was one taught by Mike Dertouzos and

00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:40.640
Steve Ward for awhile.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:43.770
But when I got involved with this, Bob Fano

00:41:43.770 --> 00:41:45.532
was teaching this.

00:41:45.532 --> 00:41:48.100
It was called 6.035.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.475
And what was it called?

00:41:51.475 --> 00:41:53.040
I think it might have been called Structure and

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.340
Interpretation of Computer Languages.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:42:00.066
And it was very focused on, here's this kind of language.

00:42:00.066 --> 00:42:02.830
The language then was ALGOL people used.

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:05.940
And then it did a little bit of LISP.

00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.450
And it was kind of an okay course.

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:12.300
Mostly famous because it was the first course.

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:17.310
But Fano did say the key thing.

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:23.220
So I talked about what you're doing is making a language and

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:26.120
how you make languages to make languages.

00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.140
The technical term for that is an interpreter.

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.930
So an interpreter is something that effectively takes the

00:42:31.930 --> 00:42:37.460
description of a language and lets the computer effectively

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:39.110
speak that language.

00:42:39.110 --> 00:42:40.450
And Fano was very--

00:42:40.450 --> 00:42:42.800
I mean he would say this in his lectures.

00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.110
I don't think any of the students got it.

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:46.700
I didn't get it until like the third time through, where he

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:50.110
sort of said the really, really key thing is that you

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:55.060
build up complexity by constructing an interpreter.

00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:58.800
And again, that's the core idea of 6.001, said in a

00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:00.670
slightly different way.

00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:04.870
So he had an enormous, enormous influence on us, but

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:08.000
also more directly.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.130
So about this time, there was a tradition in the electrical

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:18.090
engineering computer science department of when the

00:43:18.090 --> 00:43:22.750
department did the transition from kind of power engineering

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:28.790
to signals engineering in the late '50s, led by people like

00:43:28.790 --> 00:43:32.280
Ernie Guillemin and those sort legends at MIT, there was a

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:40.790
very, very influential series of textbooks that came out, I

00:43:40.790 --> 00:43:45.510
think in the late '50s, early '60s, that almost sort of set

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:49.910
the academic marker for the field of electrical

00:43:49.910 --> 00:43:52.260
engineering.

00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:55.280
So when we were there in the in the late '70s and very

00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.710
beginning of the '80s, Joel Moses and Gerry Wilson wanted

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:02.350
to do that again.

00:44:02.350 --> 00:44:05.540
So there was this notion that there would be a series of new

00:44:05.540 --> 00:44:12.030
courses and new books that the department would put out.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:15.610
And then what was going to be the computing one?

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:22.200
So Fano basically backed that Gerry and I would do the

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:23.960
computing one and do the computing course.

00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.520
And again, there was a lot of a lot of controversy there

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.340
because people didn't believe it.

00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:32.540
Fano was sort of the power in the department who really made

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:34.250
it possible for us to do that.

00:44:34.250 --> 00:44:38.030


00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:41.660
Gerry and I sort of happened into this.

00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.980
So we were sort of lucky.

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.230
And just very, very fortunate that there were some smart

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.480
people backing us.

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.760


00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:54.800
INTERVIEWER: How has introductory curriculum in ECS

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.720
changed since that time?

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:57.590
I mean clearly it's--

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.930
ABELSON: Oh, it's changed a lot.

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:00.430
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:45:00.430 --> 00:45:01.230
ABELSON: I don't know.

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:06.890
People keep using the phrase bittersweet.

00:45:06.890 --> 00:45:09.860
It's changed in style.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.310
So what happened in the department is the department

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:20.350
kind of decided that the way students get introduced into

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:25.010
the department should become more horizontal and less

00:45:25.010 --> 00:45:30.040
vertical, by which I mean when you go into the department

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:35.880
before the new curriculum, there were a bunch of very

00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:38.060
intellectually deep courses.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.530
So 6.001 really is a deep course in software

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:43.700
engineering.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:45.970
And then the idea was well, you shouldn't actually do that

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.860
because if students want to think about what they want to

00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:52.470
major in, they ought to get an experience

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.380
that's a lot more broad.

00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:58.630
So they should learn not only about software, but something

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:00.240
about circuits and something about signal

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:01.300
processing and all that.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:05.115
So 6.001 sort of didn't fit into that world.

00:46:05.115 --> 00:46:07.740


00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.820
I sort was on the committee.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:10.860
I had this funny feeling.

00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:12.060
I sort of loved the course.

00:46:12.060 --> 00:46:15.930
But I also had this feeling that the

00:46:15.930 --> 00:46:18.380
course needed to change.

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:23.460
And both Gerry and I felt that as long as we were part of it,

00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:26.120
it wasn't going to change.

00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.190
And in fact we consciously got out of it.

00:46:29.190 --> 00:46:39.100
We had an official, what you call passing of the baton

00:46:39.100 --> 00:46:42.750
ceremony in one of the lectures where Bob Fano was

00:46:42.750 --> 00:46:47.250
there as the originator of this, who let us do 6.001.

00:46:47.250 --> 00:46:50.020
And then Eric Grimson and Duane Boning were there.

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:50.770
They were going to take it over.

00:46:50.770 --> 00:46:52.620
And we kind of officially passed the baton.

00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:55.030
And we said we now did this in front

00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:57.130
of 350 student witnesses.

00:46:57.130 --> 00:46:58.770
We are never going to teach this course again.

00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:00.860
The department can't ask us.

00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.430
But then what happened is even after we got out of it, the

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:06.550
course didn't change as much.

00:47:06.550 --> 00:47:09.330
And we can flatter ourselves and say well, the ideas were

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:10.530
just really great.

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:13.290
But sometimes you just need a kick in the pants to go

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.150
someplace else.

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.530
So this new department curriculum structure turned

00:47:17.530 --> 00:47:19.950
out to be the kick in the pants.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:23.200
And so I was part of the group, along with Leslie

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:27.465
Kaelbling and Jacob White and Tomas Lozano-Perez, who sort

00:47:27.465 --> 00:47:33.610
of designed sort of the new course, which consciously was

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:36.550
not about 6.001.

00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:41.320
But a lot of the biggest themes of 6.001 about

00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.500
extraction and modularity and the way you express things,

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.170
they carry over into the new course.

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:49.210
But the new course is also doing robotics.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.850
And it's thinking that signal processing.

00:47:51.850 --> 00:47:54.220
And there's even some stuff about circuits.

00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.400
So it's not a deep course in that sense.

00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.430
And there's a lot of people who have come through MIT--

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:02.550


00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:05.140
I don't want to take credit for 6.001 and that, but I want

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:08.550
to say it was a very deep experience in how

00:48:08.550 --> 00:48:11.110
you think of software--

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:13.522
who criticized what we did.

00:48:13.522 --> 00:48:15.650
And they say they really miss it.

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:18.530
They talk about their own intellectual development as

00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:20.400
programmers.

00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.500
It was just profoundly influenced by

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.370
that kind of very--

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.730
we would sit in that class and talk about

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:26.980
the philosophy sometimes.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.180


00:48:30.180 --> 00:48:33.580
The new course does not do that in the same way.

00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:36.290
On the other hand, you have to sort of ask what's the

00:48:36.290 --> 00:48:37.590
population you're serving?

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:42.030
And the fact that you talk to the minority of students who

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.280
really, really glommed on to our way of thinking and they

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.040
say, gee, we really wish MIT were still doing that.

00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.070
I don't know what the right way of serving the most

00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.150
students are.

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:55.160
But in any case we're just doing something rather

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.260
different in motivation now.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:01.045
INTERVIEWER: So it's broader, but less deep.

00:49:01.045 --> 00:49:02.980
ABELSON: And very consciously less deep.

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.660
INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:49:05.660 --> 00:49:07.780
What are MIT students like?

00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.950
I mean how do they respond to the deep dive on the one hand

00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:17.670
or the sort of broad fire hose on the other of having to deal

00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.240
with all of these different things?

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.050
ABELSON: I think you can't generalize.

00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.580
Right.

00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:25.250
There are certainly some, I'm going to say kind of the

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:26.790
mathematical ones.

00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.490
So even though it's not mathematics, that kind of deep

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:34.660
thing is a math kind of experience.

00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:39.160
And they really would rather have something that's more

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:42.440
like the original 6.001.

00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:43.700
But then there are a whole bunch of others

00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:45.480
who just want to--

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.650
I just want to understand the breath of this field I'm

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:50.450
getting into.

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:53.100
I don't want to just because I'm going to major in

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.500
electrical engineering, have to take a whole semester of

00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:59.260
this other stuff, most of which is kind of

00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:00.510
irrelevant to me.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:03.170


00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:08.080
So again, I don't have a good sense of how the students are

00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:09.920
feeling about the population it's serving.

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:14.200
Because we did this other thing at the same time, which

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:18.550
as far as students I think has a much bigger impact.

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:20.920
So there's a whole other stream which we haven't talked

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:25.210
about at MIT and active learning, which comes from the

00:50:25.210 --> 00:50:26.120
stuff I've been doing with the

00:50:26.120 --> 00:50:28.380
Educational Technology Council.

00:50:28.380 --> 00:50:34.600
But we made a radical, radical change in the style of the

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:40.970
course, which was removing most of the lectures.

00:50:40.970 --> 00:50:46.250
So in the new course, the main thing you do with your time is

00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:48.470
you work on a project.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:51.880
And there's a big giant open lab.

00:50:51.880 --> 00:50:55.660
And the entire teaching staff of the course is present in

00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.090
this open lab.

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:00.110
And there's kind of a pyramidal structure where

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:04.200
there are undergraduate laboratory assistants, and

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:06.880
each group of them is kind of supervised by a graduate

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.380
student TA, and each group of graduate student TA's are

00:51:10.380 --> 00:51:12.460
supervised by the actual course faculty.

00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:16.160
And we're all sort of mixing it up in the course and

00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.980
sitting there talking to individual students.

00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:23.710
So rather than sitting in lecture, it's this very kind

00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:28.650
of open, interactive project-based thing.

00:51:28.650 --> 00:51:32.760
And that's such an enormous change in style, that when you

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.810
kind of ask the students well, do you like it more, how you

00:51:35.810 --> 00:51:39.300
react to it more, that's got to dominate what we were doing

00:51:39.300 --> 00:51:41.680
in terms of content.

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:42.670
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.950
I want to actually ask a whole set of questions on

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:48.040
educational technology and the developments you've been

00:51:48.040 --> 00:51:49.030
involved in.

00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:52.730
Before turning to that, at the risk of asking to generalize

00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:58.540
again about MIT students, is there any way of talking about

00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:01.570
how or whether MIT students have changed over the course

00:52:01.570 --> 00:52:03.391
of your career?

00:52:03.391 --> 00:52:06.080
ABELSON: Oh, god.

00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.130
You get the feeling that about every three years there's a

00:52:08.130 --> 00:52:09.380
new generation.

00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:17.900


00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:22.540
So the main way MIT students have changed I think is that

00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:28.770
they're more docile, as much as I hate to say.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:30.890
Marilee Jones, who was admissions director, actually

00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:32.525
thought about this a lot.

00:52:32.525 --> 00:52:37.295


00:52:37.295 --> 00:52:39.570
Remember in the '60s, MIT took half of its applicants.

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:42.100


00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:47.670
And now it takes what, 10 percent, under 10 percent?

00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:53.510
And the students who end up getting into MIT are coming

00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:59.920
from a way more competitive environment.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.650
And in general, and in tremendous exceptions, they

00:53:05.650 --> 00:53:10.390
have been successful by kind of listening to their parents

00:53:10.390 --> 00:53:13.900
and listening to adults.

00:53:13.900 --> 00:53:18.240
And that's led to a tendency that students I think have too

00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:23.110
much respect for what adults or like faculty or something

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:24.340
are saying.

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:29.220
So there's really a sense of just kind of well they sort of

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:30.520
know better and they have good things.

00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:31.210
And they go along it.

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:35.450
And there's not as much a sense of really challenging

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:37.710
the system.

00:53:37.710 --> 00:53:41.760
Now I don't know whether that's a generational thing or

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.990
whether it's this particular kind of influence at the top

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:45.240
schools like MIT.

00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.050


00:53:48.050 --> 00:53:49.665
When's the last time you saw students take over

00:53:49.665 --> 00:53:50.915
a building at MIT?

00:53:50.915 --> 00:53:54.750


00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:57.920
Like I said, when I showed up at MIT when I saw that happen,

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.070
I said what incredibly an healthy thing to happen.

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:04.550
And now we get upset if students

00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:06.730
crack into an elevator.

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:11.050
So there's really this sense of the students becoming--

00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.270
I mean docile may be not quite-- the wrong word--

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:16.280
but sort of too much respect for what the

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.360
Institution is doing.

00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.430
And I sort of wish that would change.

00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:24.290
So that's sort of the big change that I see.

00:54:24.290 --> 00:54:30.820
INTERVIEWER: What price do we pay if the students are more

00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.920
sort of quick to fall in line or to do what's expected,

00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.930
rather than to push boundaries, I mean if any?

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:41.160
ABELSON: I think its brilliance, its creativity,

00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:42.410
its achievement.

00:54:42.410 --> 00:54:47.310


00:54:47.310 --> 00:54:51.590
When you think about any place or MIT, you sort of think in

00:54:51.590 --> 00:54:54.610
terms of the characters.

00:54:54.610 --> 00:54:57.710
Who are the characters around this place who give it

00:54:57.710 --> 00:54:58.660
tremendous flavor?

00:54:58.660 --> 00:55:01.490
Maybe they're not the smartest people or doing

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:02.140
the greatest things.

00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:04.930
But they add spice to it.

00:55:04.930 --> 00:55:10.610
And you have to make room and just really venerate those

00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:11.520
kind of people.

00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.780
And the more we worry about those people are going to be

00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.385
doing something destructive or they'll be wasting time or

00:55:18.385 --> 00:55:21.720
they'll be wasting resources or something, the more you

00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.430
lose that kind of spice.

00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:29.260
And I sort of hope MIT never loses that, although there's

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:33.580
just a lot of I don't quite want to say regimentation, but

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:36.610
it's just I'd say a little lack of

00:55:36.610 --> 00:55:38.880
tolerance for the oddballs.

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:42.520
And we have to just treasure the oddballs more.

00:55:42.520 --> 00:55:46.130
INTERVIEWER: So turning to educational technology, you've

00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:50.460
been deeply involved in any number of initiatives and

00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:54.460
deployment of programs since you've been at MIT.

00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:55.940
ABELSON: Since 1969.

00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:57.100
INTERVIEWER: Yes.

00:55:57.100 --> 00:56:00.800
Tell me first of all where does that interest come from?

00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:05.180
Why is it something that you have spent so much time and

00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:06.994
energy and effort on?

00:56:06.994 --> 00:56:09.960
ABELSON: So part of it quite frankly was this accident

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:13.250
about going over to the AI Lab, meeting

00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:14.980
Papert in the elevator.

00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:20.250
But again, also the sense that I think a lot of people have

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:23.210
of the joy of explaining things.

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:26.350
And then the particular thing about--

00:56:26.350 --> 00:56:29.760
well, for me it's computers and educational technology.

00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:32.140
It's not just explaining things.

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:36.310
It's empowering people to do them.

00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:41.160
So even going back to the original sort of Logo turtle,

00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.980
which is the first thing I worked on, it's not that oh,

00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:44.990
it's sort of cool.

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:46.980
You might think about geometric designs.

00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:52.720
But I can make this world where students can kind of

00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:56.870
explore and do things that are both unexpected and

00:56:56.870 --> 00:56:58.720
explainable.

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:05.030
And that's sort of the root of how I think about educational

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:06.740
technology.

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:12.000
But then there was a shift.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.216
I guess for me it came--

00:57:14.216 --> 00:57:17.840
oh, it didn't come until the late '80s or even the

00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:22.330
mid-'90s, where I started thinking about the institution

00:57:22.330 --> 00:57:23.580
in educational technology.

00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:28.430


00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:32.020
There's this whole other ethic which is how should an

00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:34.530
institution behave in that world?

00:57:34.530 --> 00:57:39.940
So it's not only about how you effectively transmit things to

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.250
students or do them.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:44.790
It's what what's it mean for an institution to actually

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:50.540
live in the world as a responsible citizen?

00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:54.600
And I became really interested in that.

00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:59.190
The person who for me embodies that and still embodies that

00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:04.950
is Chuck Vest. His whole presidency was this sense of

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:11.140
is MIT acting as a responsible, ethical being in

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:11.990
what it can do?

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:17.890
So I think about educational technology in that way.

00:58:17.890 --> 00:58:21.980
It's not only how do we behave towards our own student body,

00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:24.890
it's how do we behave towards the world?

00:58:24.890 --> 00:58:29.190
So there is the sense that you often here of MIT, this sense

00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:35.470
that MIT is a precious world resource.

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:38.250
And I certainly believe that's true.

00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:41.510
And then the question is, with terms of education and

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:47.850
educational technology, how do you sort of step up to that

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:49.470
obligation?

00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:52.010
And part of it is how you behave as a

00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:54.510
model for other places.

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:58.560
So even going back to like the book that Gerry Sussman and I

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:03.170
wrote, there was always this sense that when you're writing

00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:06.050
a textbook at MIT, it's not really that they're going to

00:59:06.050 --> 00:59:10.700
be big sales about it, because in our case it was gosh, we're

00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:12.740
teaching computer programming and it's got calculus in

00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:14.170
chapter one.

00:59:14.170 --> 00:59:15.410
How could you use that?

00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:18.560
But it's the sense of you're sort of writing it for the

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.330
people who are going to write the next round of books for

00:59:21.330 --> 00:59:22.360
everybody else.

00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:26.990
So a sense of people are watching and it

00:59:26.990 --> 00:59:30.170
matters what you do.

00:59:30.170 --> 00:59:32.780
And that's kind of a little bit what's behind

00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:33.440
OpenCourseWare.

00:59:33.440 --> 00:59:34.840
It's not just me.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:40.750
The original notion about OpenCourseWare is we thought

00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:43.900
that our audience in

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:48.040
OpenCourseWare were other educators.

00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:53.450
And the way that whole initiative was crafted where

00:59:53.450 --> 00:59:59.370
we said it's really important that we show all MIT courses

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:01.030
because what you're trying to exhibit

01:00:01.030 --> 01:00:06.080
there, your model was--

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.060
I'm very consciously--

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:11.780
the education minister in some third-world country would like

01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:16.060
to understand what that country should be doing about

01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:18.280
chemical engineering.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.310
And then you sort of see displayed out before you is

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:27.520
what MIT, the top institution in the world, thinks is

01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.700
chemical engineering.

01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:32.070
And this is what was in our heads when we made

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:32.850
OpenCourseWare.

01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:36.260
Of course it didn't quite work that way because what we say,

01:00:36.260 --> 01:00:38.980
oh my god, they're all these people who actually want to

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.400
learn chemical engineering, who look at this stuff.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:47.610
And that should have been obvious in hindsight because

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:51.640
there are many more students in the world than educators.

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:54.150
But we were surprised by that.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:57.100
But to get back to the original ethos of that, is

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:01.310
you're setting yourself up as a model and you're trying to

01:01:01.310 --> 01:01:03.850
influence the influencers.

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:06.060
And what you do matters.

01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.760
And that's not only a technical obligation, it's an

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:13.660
ethical obligation for how you behave and how

01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:14.500
you think about it.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:17.170
And that's kind of how I think about educational

01:01:17.170 --> 01:01:18.000
technologies.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.540
It's with that sense of you're creating a model.

01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:26.230
You have an obligation to sort of see that it works out right

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:28.650
with respect to how you think the world is evolving and how

01:01:28.650 --> 01:01:31.370
you think the internet is evolving.

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:34.440
But much, much of MIT is like that.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:39.020
It's a whole ethos of service that's really integral to how

01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.650
much of this community works.

01:01:41.650 --> 01:01:43.850
INTERVIEWER: Tell me a bit more about the genesis of

01:01:43.850 --> 01:01:45.340
OpenCourseWare.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:49.480
I know that when I first heard about it at the time it was

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:53.210
first announced, I guess certainly not before then, it

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:56.890
was somewhat from my very limited perspective it seemed

01:01:56.890 --> 01:01:59.750
very shocking that MIT would do that.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:03.470
And I'm just really interested in the genesis, the thought

01:02:03.470 --> 01:02:07.985
process institutionally, and also for you personally?

01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:08.430
ABELSON: Yeah.

01:02:08.430 --> 01:02:11.110
The only disappointment I have about OpenCourseWare is that

01:02:11.110 --> 01:02:16.370
we announced it after the internet bubble had peaked.

01:02:16.370 --> 01:02:26.040
Again, if you go back to the late '90s, right, 1998, 1999,

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:31.410
2000, there was this sense, if you read in the educational

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:34.410
technology press or the education news, that

01:02:34.410 --> 01:02:36.980
universities were sitting on a gold mine.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:44.170
People talked about literally a $2 trillion economy coming

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:47.670
out of universities, taking their course materials and

01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:50.500
putting them on the network.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:57.670
And I just loved it that in that climate, MIT said hey,

01:02:57.670 --> 01:03:00.350
we're giving it away.

01:03:00.350 --> 01:03:05.790
Education is being part of the community of interacting and

01:03:05.790 --> 01:03:08.410
doing research and being part of it.

01:03:08.410 --> 01:03:09.410
That's why you come to MIT.

01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:13.980
That stuff you can watch on television, we

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.210
just give that away.

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:18.070
So I just loved saying that.

01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:22.640
Now that came from kind of a different place.

01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:27.250
That was a wonderfully well-crafted story that fit

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:28.670
where we wanted to be in that place.

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:35.850
But in fact what happened is Bob Brown, who was provost

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:44.270
then, formed the Council on Educational Technology, which

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:48.220
he and I ran together for a couple years.

01:03:48.220 --> 01:03:53.440
And that came from a prior thing, where as Chuck Vest

01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:57.050
would say, he'd go around the country around 1997 and give

01:03:57.050 --> 01:03:57.710
these talks.

01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:01.150
And people would say, there's this internet.

01:04:01.150 --> 01:04:05.820
What's MIT's going to do about it, quite literally?

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.690
And so was a sense of what MIT should do.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:14.260
And a bunch of councils and groups met.

01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:16.050
There was a thing--

01:04:16.050 --> 01:04:18.050
I forget with the name was, but there was a council that

01:04:18.050 --> 01:04:21.940
sort of talked about MIT's agenda going ahead and talked

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.610
about all sorts of stuff.

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:28.830
And they barely mentioned that there was an internet.

01:04:28.830 --> 01:04:31.940
There was a phrase that said--

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:32.740
literal phrase--

01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:35.810
MIT should focus 02139.

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:39.640
And there was this grudging idea that there was something

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:43.030
outside in terms of the opportunities for MIT going

01:04:43.030 --> 01:04:44.600
forward in the future.

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:47.310
And then there was another committee which said the

01:04:47.310 --> 01:04:52.240
opposite, that was run by Nick Negroponte and Mike Dertouzos,

01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.390
that basically said, gosh, MIT is the most wonderful

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:54.870
place in the world.

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:55.860
We should be expansive.

01:04:55.860 --> 01:04:58.990
And we should just take millions of dollars and invest

01:04:58.990 --> 01:05:01.380
this in all sorts of technology things.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:06.540
And these two committees were kind of at loggerheads.

01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.420
What kind of happened is the technology committee got

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:12.720
saddled with, you guys are just a bunch of technological

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:13.950
determinism.

01:05:13.950 --> 01:05:16.240
In this place, we don't have to think about it.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:18.860
The other committee said wow, this is really about the

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.810
spirit of MIT.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:24.070
But there was tremendous dissatisfaction because it was

01:05:24.070 --> 01:05:26.720
just ignoring the way the world was going.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.250
And so Bob Brown sort of wanted to find a way to

01:05:30.250 --> 01:05:33.600
mediate this stuff, to think about what's the way forward,

01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:34.380
looking at these things.

01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:39.280
And he formed the Council on Educational Technology, which

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.460
it's kind of hidden agenda was to do that, find a path.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:52.020
So one of the things we did is we actually got McKinsey in to

01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:53.210
do a consulting--

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:55.980
their standard kind of strategic consulting, saying

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:58.460
where we are we going, what are the opportunities?

01:05:58.460 --> 01:06:01.170
And we kind of said MIT is doing a whole bunch of

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:04.180
disjointed things.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:07.680
One of the consultant's had a really nice graphic he made

01:06:07.680 --> 01:06:08.650
with a whole bunch of sailboats

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:10.000
that were MIT things.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.190
And all the sailboats were going off in all kinds of

01:06:12.190 --> 01:06:13.440
different directions.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:15.630


01:06:15.630 --> 01:06:19.040
And we did a survey of the MIT community

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:21.460
about what's important.

01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:27.460
And what was interesting is not coming from us on this ed

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:34.690
tech council, but as said back to us by the consultants, it

01:06:34.690 --> 01:06:38.050
said, gee, what's really important at MIT is the

01:06:38.050 --> 01:06:42.430
integration of research and education.

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:43.270
And now what's that say?

01:06:43.270 --> 01:06:46.170
That says if you're thinking about distance learning in

01:06:46.170 --> 01:06:54.890
this sense, if somehow that is just curriculum material and

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.560
it's not infused with the notion of research, that's

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.450
kind of not an MIT education.

01:06:59.450 --> 01:07:02.630
So that one kind of fundamental they heard.

01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:04.470
Another one they heard which this notion of

01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:06.770
an integrated faculty.

01:07:06.770 --> 01:07:09.780
So MIT, unlike lots of other places, has this

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:11.020
notion of one faculty.

01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:14.470
We don't have graduate faculty or we don't have teaching

01:07:14.470 --> 01:07:16.120
faculty and research faculty.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.800
We have faculty.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:19.470
And there's the sense if you're on the faculty, you're

01:07:19.470 --> 01:07:21.730
supposed to do all of these things.

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:27.610
So there's this notion of if we really went and like oh,

01:07:27.610 --> 01:07:30.760
the Harvard Extension School, had a whole bunch of people

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:33.590
who are not actual Harvard faculty who were teaching this

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:38.610
thing, ahh, that's not the sort of thing MIT does.

01:07:38.610 --> 01:07:42.080
So there were a bunch of principles like that.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:45.410
And eventually we were sort of saying as MIT goes forward, do

01:07:45.410 --> 01:07:48.830
we think about expanding to new communities?

01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:55.280


01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.160
Right now we think of our potential student body as the

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:03.350
top whatever it is, two percent, three percent of

01:08:03.350 --> 01:08:05.200
students in the world.

01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.590
Should we be the top 10 percent?

01:08:08.590 --> 01:08:13.490
So there was this notion of who we actually talk to?

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:16.819
And we kind of strategically said we actually want to stay

01:08:16.819 --> 01:08:20.000
with the communities of people that we know.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:25.170
And we want to stay with an MIT of kind of style thing.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:29.300
And that morphed into a thing that said we really want to

01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:36.910
change the dynamic of how a student interacts with MIT to

01:08:36.910 --> 01:08:39.270
something that can be lifelong.

01:08:39.270 --> 01:08:42.529
So there was this idea that right now you graduate MIT,

01:08:42.529 --> 01:08:46.020
and what it means basically means to be an alum is that

01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:50.090
every year the Institute sends you requests for money.

01:08:50.090 --> 01:08:54.240
And we're saying shouldn't there be a different kind of

01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:57.490
thing with that where you can participate in this community

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:58.970
intellectually for a long time?

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:00.853
So that was one of these things

01:09:00.853 --> 01:09:02.103
called lifelong education.

01:09:02.103 --> 01:09:04.729


01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:09.300
And so out of that strategic thing, there came another

01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:10.890
thing, saying well, we kind of decided

01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:13.149
on that as the direction.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:16.149
Let's mush out this lifelong learning thing.

01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:17.229
Let's figure out what it is.

01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:19.460
We actually did another consulting engagement with

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:23.130
Booz Allen, who came in as very analytical, saying is

01:09:23.130 --> 01:09:25.149
this going to work?

01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:30.630
And basically after long drawn-out things and analyses

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:34.620
and talking to possible clients and competitors and

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:36.609
offices at MIT about everything, they found it

01:09:36.609 --> 01:09:38.520
wasn't going to work.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:44.040
So they called in one of their spreadsheet ninjas, who made

01:09:44.040 --> 01:09:48.340
this giant thing with every possible parameter you could

01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:50.710
imagine, what are the production values, how long is

01:09:50.710 --> 01:09:52.350
the course, what's the client thing.

01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:56.600
And basically it turned out that, I forget, if you've got

01:09:56.600 --> 01:10:01.980
20,000 doing a course, you could kind of

01:10:01.980 --> 01:10:05.740
a break-even, maybe.

01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.570
So this whole committee was actually pretty-- oh my god,

01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:11.620
what are we going to do?

01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:13.430
And finally, I think it was Dick Yue,

01:10:13.430 --> 01:10:14.600
there's some famous story--

01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:15.590
I don't know if you talked to him.

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:17.480
There's this famous story about he was

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.490
exercising or something.

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:21.550
And it sort of came to him about well, why don't we take

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.780
this stuff and give it away.

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.520
And that sounds like a crazy idea.

01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:28.270
But then you sort of think well you know, if we're not

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:33.080
going to make money charging alumni and other people to do

01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.340
this, maybe we can get foundations to pay for this.

01:10:36.340 --> 01:10:39.900
So it wasn't a totally crazy idea.

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:46.100
And then at the end of the summer what happened was the

01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.410
committee produced this report.

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:51.630
So that was the other thing that Dick did.

01:10:51.630 --> 01:10:53.320
MIT believes in data.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:56.210
And he did this amazing thing, which is whenever the

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:59.630
consultants would do anything, they'd interview somebody, and

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.020
he'd sort of xerox the sheet.

01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:03.210
And he put it in this big notebook.

01:11:03.210 --> 01:11:07.790
And he had a notebook which was literally this high.

01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:10.680
And when he'd come in to make a presentation, he'd put the

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:13.690
notebook on the desk, saying the committee has done this

01:11:13.690 --> 01:11:16.300
research for its conclusions.

01:11:16.300 --> 01:11:19.430
And nobody would dare challenge him on that, despite

01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:21.570
the fact that nothing in the notebook was relevant to what

01:11:21.570 --> 01:11:22.132
he was saying.

01:11:22.132 --> 01:11:23.710
It was just a great, great ploy.

01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:26.210
But it's again, engineer's culture.

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:28.810
We like data.

01:11:28.810 --> 01:11:33.300
But the committee's report was this incredibly precise

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.430
reasoned out, spreadsheet-backed, financial

01:11:36.430 --> 01:11:41.710
model thing about how we could do some for pay lifelong

01:11:41.710 --> 01:11:44.780
learning things with careful analysis.

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:47.530
And then at the end, there was about two pages.

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:49.180
It said, and by the way, we have this other idea that we

01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.830
should just give it away.

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.620
And we'll call it OpenCourseWare.

01:11:52.620 --> 01:11:54.770
With no analysis or anything.

01:11:54.770 --> 01:12:00.680
And then to its tremendous credit, Chuck Bastian, Bob and

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.030
Tom Magnanti got inspired by this and said yeah, this one

01:12:04.030 --> 01:12:05.230
seems right.

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:09.210
And that's what actually started the path towards

01:12:09.210 --> 01:12:10.870
OpenCourseWare.

01:12:10.870 --> 01:12:13.690
And then there were a lot of talks with--

01:12:13.690 --> 01:12:15.570
Chuck went and got money from the Hewlett and Mellon

01:12:15.570 --> 01:12:16.940
foundations.

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:18.820
And we did a bunch of things, talked with the

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:20.230
faculty over the year.

01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:22.810
But that's kind of how it started.

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:27.540
And again, it started in this world of MIT is going to be

01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:29.480
the exemplar.

01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:33.690
So we weren't talking really about distance education.

01:12:33.690 --> 01:12:36.203
We weren't even thinking about the students who

01:12:36.203 --> 01:12:36.390
were going to do it.

01:12:36.390 --> 01:12:38.800
We were thinking about here MIT is

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.110
exhibiting itself as a model.

01:12:41.110 --> 01:12:44.800


01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:47.600
It was right for 2000.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:50.600
And it sort of grabbed everybody's imagination.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.520
And then it happened as you said, at exactly the time that

01:12:54.520 --> 01:12:57.650
lots of these other universities were saying wow,

01:12:57.650 --> 01:12:59.340
we're going to make tremendous money for this.

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:00.650
There were lots of start-ups.

01:13:00.650 --> 01:13:02.630
I don't know if people noticed.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:04.670
I once went back and looked.

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:07.740
And there were lots and lots of places that when we did the

01:13:07.740 --> 01:13:11.520
original McKinsey analysis, were saying, oh god, these

01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:12.280
people are starting.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:13.110
Their company is starting.

01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:14.570
Their university is doing stuff.

01:13:14.570 --> 01:13:17.470
None of them are in business anymore.

01:13:17.470 --> 01:13:19.670
And it was just great that we can be so

01:13:19.670 --> 01:13:20.960
counter-intuitive as MIT.

01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.570
A very MIT thing.

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:28.290
INTERVIEWER: Can you talk a bit about the faculty reaction

01:13:28.290 --> 01:13:33.160
when OCW was first floated as a concept.

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.290
Supportive, not supportive, what was the response?

01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:38.630
ABELSON: It was surprisingly supportive.

01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:41.730
And in fact Larry Bacow, who was chancellor then, basically

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:45.440
said, look, you cannot go ahead with this unless you

01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:48.110
really go, really talk to the faculty.

01:13:48.110 --> 01:13:50.700
So there was a group of about four or five of us who made

01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:54.110
presentations to every single MIT department.

01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:56.200
And we listened to a lot of stuff.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.670


01:13:59.670 --> 01:14:04.490
I'd say the predominant negative reaction was oh my

01:14:04.490 --> 01:14:09.500
god, you want to take my class notes and put them out on the

01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:11.210
internet for everybody to look at.

01:14:11.210 --> 01:14:12.450
They're not good enough.

01:14:12.450 --> 01:14:16.630
And we got really good it saying hey, you're willing to

01:14:16.630 --> 01:14:19.270
give this to MIT students who are paying $40,000 dollars a

01:14:19.270 --> 01:14:20.630
year to listen to you.

01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:22.790
And you don't think they're good enough to put out for

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.940
free to other people to look at?

01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:27.300
So we learned to make interesting

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.370
answers to those things.

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:31.770
But it was to me surprisingly positive.

01:14:31.770 --> 01:14:36.650
What everyone was expecting was, oh my god, you're giving

01:14:36.650 --> 01:14:38.190
away my intellectual property.

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:40.930


01:14:40.930 --> 01:14:43.880
I mean there might have been five people who said that.

01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:45.050
But it was almost unheard of.

01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:47.410
It was much more than the other reaction I said: well

01:14:47.410 --> 01:14:51.910
god, you're showing my stuff in other than its pristine

01:14:51.910 --> 01:14:54.370
state after I've worked on the publication

01:14:54.370 --> 01:14:56.530
manuscript for a long time.

01:14:56.530 --> 01:14:58.170
But it was just very, very popular.

01:14:58.170 --> 01:15:01.050
And it certainly helped that the administration was so

01:15:01.050 --> 01:15:03.420
incredibly visibly positive about this.

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:06.770


01:15:06.770 --> 01:15:10.030
But again OpenCourseWare got positioned.

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:12.400
We made some adjustments, some tweaks in the way we told the

01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:13.260
story and what we did.

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:15.560
I frankly don't remember what they were.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:19.520
But it was really very important to us that this came

01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:22.480
out as an expression of the MIT community.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.560
So it wasn't a administration driven,

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.080
something, something, something.

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.030
It really was an expression of what the faculty wanted to do.

01:15:31.030 --> 01:15:34.460
INTERVIEWER: So you talked about OpenCourseWare as one

01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:38.310
example of MIT or what MIT does being an exemplar.

01:15:38.310 --> 01:15:43.150
Ten plus years out, what has OCW's impact been on the

01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:44.900
broader world?

01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.300
ABELSON: Oh, well OCW created what's called

01:15:47.300 --> 01:15:49.800
Open Educational Resources.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:58.130
So there is now an enormous I want to say movement that's

01:15:58.130 --> 01:16:01.080
called OER, Open Educational Resources.

01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:07.690
That word started at a UN conference which was talking

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:10.110
about OpenCourseWare and some more things.

01:16:10.110 --> 01:16:12.370
That's where the word got coined.

01:16:12.370 --> 01:16:15.200
And it got elevated to--

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:18.040
I forget what the phrase is-- how do you think about

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:23.930
education and the internet to improve the state of humanity?

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:26.070
And really a very long thing.

01:16:26.070 --> 01:16:29.840
But now there's an enormous, enormous whole open

01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.640
educational resources movement.

01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.830
You've got to remember when OpenCourseWare started, there

01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:42.900
was not the idea that universities at scale would

01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.130
put educational material on the internet for free.

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:48.840
And now that's, well sure, ho hum.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:52.430
So it caused just a major change in the

01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:53.120
way people did it.

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:57.990
And it was a combination of that the time was kind of

01:16:57.990 --> 01:17:00.210
right for it, the technology was right for it.

01:17:00.210 --> 01:17:03.750
But also MIT put its institutional

01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:06.260
imprimatur on that idea.

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.620
So it's been enormous.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:13.730
And not all of it identifies itself as universities.

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:18.640
And not all of it identifies itself as

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.850
certainly MIT or something.

01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:26.100
But just the idea that you can now go to the internet and

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.710
find a lot of educational material, that's what

01:17:28.710 --> 01:17:30.910
OpenCourseWare started.

01:17:30.910 --> 01:17:32.730
INTERVIEWER: What do you see as the

01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:34.910
future for that movement?

01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:40.100
ABELSON: So this is something that we think about a lot with

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:46.020
OpenCourseWare and a lot from places like Creative Commons.

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.280
I kind of want to say it's done.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:50.930


01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:54.260
Again, I have to say there really was a question, right,

01:17:54.260 --> 01:17:57.260
in 2000, about whether there could be a lot of free

01:17:57.260 --> 01:17:58.840
educational material on the internet.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:00.020
It really was a question.

01:18:00.020 --> 01:18:01.570
Now it's not.

01:18:01.570 --> 01:18:04.830
And in a sense that's kind of happened.

01:18:04.830 --> 01:18:07.250
So the real future now is how do you make

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:08.980
that stuff more usable?

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:11.490


01:18:11.490 --> 01:18:13.930
There's no sense of all the quality of it.

01:18:13.930 --> 01:18:17.760
There's no sense that I can really get certification that

01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:18.850
comes from it.

01:18:18.850 --> 01:18:20.910
There's no real sense of how it fits together.

01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:24.480
There's no sense of gosh, here are three different

01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:28.530
presentations of diffraction.

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:29.330
How do they compare?

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.870
Which one should I use?

01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:35.140
So at the moment what's happening it's a tremendous

01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:39.830
amount of raw material that has not very

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:42.610
effectively been mined.

01:18:42.610 --> 01:18:44.690
And what's happening now is there are lots and lots of

01:18:44.690 --> 01:18:49.090
both nonprofit companies and for profit start-ups that are

01:18:49.090 --> 01:18:51.140
trying to mine that in some effective way.

01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:52.580
Nobody's cracked it yet.

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:54.250
But that's where it needs to go.

01:18:54.250 --> 01:18:59.550
And it's kind of hard problem because it's one thing to

01:18:59.550 --> 01:19:01.350
publish a lot of material on the network.

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:04.200
But when you start talking about real education, you're

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:08.410
talking about interaction with people and empowering groups

01:19:08.410 --> 01:19:13.000
to do stuff, thinking about did people actually learn the

01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.660
stuff, do you certify it, how do you certify it,

01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:16.000
how do you use it?

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:18.260
So it's a lot harder work.

01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:20.610
And that's where the movement has to go.

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:22.590
INTERVIEWER: So you mentioned that a lot of that's

01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:23.980
unresolved.

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:28.310
But are there directions or ideas that you have in terms

01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:32.090
of making this material more usable or things that need to

01:19:32.090 --> 01:19:32.200
be addressed?

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:32.910
ABELSON: Oh sure.

01:19:32.910 --> 01:19:38.130
I mean me and a thousand other people.

01:19:38.130 --> 01:19:39.460
They're all sorts of elements to it.

01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:41.860
Can I find something?

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:44.930
If I want to go find an explanation of magnetism

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:50.260
that's really good for eighth graders, can I find that?

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.920
There are lots of places that are working on that.

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:53.980
Google is working on that.

01:19:53.980 --> 01:19:55.730
Creative Commons is working on that.

01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:58.720
Lots and lots of places doing that.

01:19:58.720 --> 01:20:03.720
The other one is how do you bridge the gap between even

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:08.450
for profit textbooks and this open stuff?

01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:12.730
Or to say it another way, if there's a lot of open stuff,

01:20:12.730 --> 01:20:14.920
there are a lot of people who are starting companies that

01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:20.670
say well, what's the missing piece in that, that I can add

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:22.540
that'll be a sustainable business.

01:20:22.540 --> 01:20:24.760
And sometimes it's certification and sometimes

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:28.030
it's editing of the things and sometimes it's organization

01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:31.660
and sometimes it's adding some special videos or

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:33.030
something to it.

01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:36.280
People just exploring that all over the map.

01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.010
That really is the big thing in educational

01:20:38.010 --> 01:20:39.750
technology right now.

01:20:39.750 --> 01:20:43.680
There are textbook companies that say how do I make a

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:47.300
mixture of the stuff I hire people to write things, but

01:20:47.300 --> 01:20:50.590
also back on to all of this open stuff?

01:20:50.590 --> 01:20:53.630
So there's not going to be one answer.

01:20:53.630 --> 01:20:56.770
And I think there's going to be an explosion over the next

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:59.170
oh five years, of people trying lots and lots of

01:20:59.170 --> 01:21:00.180
different things.

01:21:00.180 --> 01:21:00.630
And who knows?

01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:04.580
It might converge on something after a while.

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:07.570
INTERVIEWER: So you've been involved in obviously other

01:21:07.570 --> 01:21:11.600
initiatives as well that are very, very significant,

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.870
iCampus being one, DSpace.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:17.030


01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:19.890
Talk a bit about those.

01:21:19.890 --> 01:21:21.970
And I'm kind of lumping them together, just part in the

01:21:21.970 --> 01:21:22.890
interest of time.

01:21:22.890 --> 01:21:25.930
But I'm going to let you sort of tell me what you think are

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:28.350
the most significant?

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:31.620
And maybe just sort of wrapping it in the larger

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:36.390
question of how technology has changed and continues to

01:21:36.390 --> 01:21:39.660
change the classroom experience?

01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:43.720
ABELSON: So sort of big area.

01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:44.810
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:47.950
And we can take it in pieces, if that's easy.

01:21:47.950 --> 01:21:52.120
ABELSON: So DSpace is kind of not

01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.330
really about the classroom.

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:55.620
But it's one I like to talk about because that one's

01:21:55.620 --> 01:21:56.800
actually strategic.

01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:59.590
That was actually--

01:21:59.590 --> 01:22:02.855
I almost want to say crafted by Ann Wolpert, who's the head

01:22:02.855 --> 01:22:10.430
of libraries, and me, having to do with the issue of, will

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:17.160
the public be able to get access to university research?

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:21.970
So OpenCourseWare is about this vision of the educational

01:22:21.970 --> 01:22:24.550
materials of the world's greatest institutions are

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:26.860
available to all of humanity.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:32.690
DSpace is about the vision of are the research let's say

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:38.540
products of the top research enterprises in the world

01:22:38.540 --> 01:22:40.110
available to all of humanity?

01:22:40.110 --> 01:22:42.200
It's that vision.

01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:44.450
And then you sort of want to say well okay, well it's easy.

01:22:44.450 --> 01:22:48.200


01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.300
In fact, we should just post this on the internet.

01:22:51.300 --> 01:22:54.200
And then you say why not?

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:56.930
And then you find that there's no sense of gosh, what's it's

01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:58.740
mean to post it on the internet?

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:03.710
Is there a trusted place that has a pedigree in putting my

01:23:03.710 --> 01:23:08.380
research materials out in a way that they're going to be

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:11.000
proper stewardship of those?

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:16.320
And so we said one place to do that is

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.820
the research libraries.

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:22.060
So the libraries of the top research institutions could

01:23:22.060 --> 01:23:23.700
fulfill that role.

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:25.480
And DSpace was really about that.

01:23:25.480 --> 01:23:28.830


01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:29.870
This was very early.

01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:33.370
And it was kind of saying well look, we see-- when was this,

01:23:33.370 --> 01:23:35.170
1999 or something?

01:23:35.170 --> 01:23:38.240
We kind of see this thing brewing with the ability to

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.530
put stuff on the internet.

01:23:40.530 --> 01:23:43.680
And we see this is going to be coming more and more of a

01:23:43.680 --> 01:23:45.370
controversial flash point thing.

01:23:45.370 --> 01:23:47.570
We were absolutely right about that.

01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:52.080
And we said what's missing from that is the notion that a

01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:58.660
university research library could be a place that a

01:23:58.660 --> 01:24:02.296
research scientist would trust as a place to

01:24:02.296 --> 01:24:03.060
look around the internet.

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:05.090
So DSpace was about creating that.

01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:08.120
And that's happened to a large extent.

01:24:08.120 --> 01:24:10.330
It needs to happen a lot more.

01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:14.170
We're now in the interesting stage of that where the

01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:16.990
publishers and journals are fighting back.

01:24:16.990 --> 01:24:21.960
So you know the famous Gandhi thing.

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.760
First, they ignore you.

01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:23.570
Then they laugh at you.

01:24:23.570 --> 01:24:24.830
Then they fight you.

01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:26.700
Then they lose.

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:30.240
So we're sort of starting to get into then

01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:32.600
they fight us stage.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:36.700
But I have a lot of optimism that'll work out.

01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:41.800
So DSpace is not particularly about the classroom.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:46.630
But the classroom stuff is a very, very complicated mix

01:24:46.630 --> 01:24:50.580
because part of what you want to think about is making it

01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:55.070
expansive, making this world of sharing, making this world

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:57.480
where stuff is very possible.

01:24:57.480 --> 01:25:01.500
But at the same time, you want to think about what's really

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.080
special about MIT.

01:25:04.080 --> 01:25:08.650
What's the stuff that I want to do in my class that I

01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:11.660
really don't want to share, because I want to say to these

01:25:11.660 --> 01:25:13.930
students, my god, you're not just in any place.

01:25:13.930 --> 01:25:15.480
You're at MIT.

01:25:15.480 --> 01:25:17.240
And this thing that's happening in this classroom

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:20.800
now is really about our small group.

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.020
And it's personal things.

01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:24.480
And I don't know where that ends out.

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.610
But I think both of those things are

01:25:27.610 --> 01:25:30.050
happening at the same time.

01:25:30.050 --> 01:25:35.320
And so that ends up being a whole bunch of different kinds

01:25:35.320 --> 01:25:39.230
of initiatives that look at that in different ways.

01:25:39.230 --> 01:25:43.630
So one of them is the thing we funded under the Microsoft

01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:47.700
iCampus Alliance, which is the notion of remote laboratories,

01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:52.900
the iLabs thing that initially started with Jesus del Alamo

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:56.370
in electronic engineering that said, gosh, I'm doing these

01:25:56.370 --> 01:26:02.290
labs for MIT students who are taking this thing.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:03.910
And just think about what it takes to a lab.

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:07.650
You come in, and you have to spend 30 minutes setting it

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:09.440
up, and the equipment's broken, and you have to go

01:26:09.440 --> 01:26:11.940
through the safety class to make sure you don't do things.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:16.010
When the reality is, you're just doing a three minute

01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:17.550
experiment.

01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:19.500
Wouldn't it be nice if you could do that from your dorm

01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:21.180
room over the internet?

01:26:21.180 --> 01:26:24.710
And that was sort of where Jesus's his vision of that

01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:27.170
started in the circuits course.

01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:29.760
And then we sort of said yeah, once you do that, once you can

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:32.030
be across the campus, hey it's on the web.

01:26:32.030 --> 01:26:33.810
It could be across the world.

01:26:33.810 --> 01:26:37.850
So there's this view of can you take those real laboratory

01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:42.860
experiences and in a sense make them accessed remotely?

01:26:42.860 --> 01:26:44.950
So that's a little bit of trying to bridge this, hey,

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:49.360
it's special, but it's also accessible kind of thing.

01:26:49.360 --> 01:26:53.230


01:26:53.230 --> 01:26:58.440
The stuff that I'd love to be playing with now is how you do

01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:00.050
like remote tutoring?

01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:05.130
How do I make it so if I'm in some kind of laboratory or

01:27:05.130 --> 01:27:08.400
some kind of classroom session where I'm getting individual

01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:12.070
instruction, you could also imagine doing that

01:27:12.070 --> 01:27:14.760
from across the world?

01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:17.370
Those are some of the things that I'm trying to think about

01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:21.420
with the ed tech council right now.

01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:24.180
And then at the same time there's the evolution of

01:27:24.180 --> 01:27:28.250
OpenCourseWare like things.

01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:32.280
We're sort of moving to a new stage in that where the idea

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.490
that there's effectively a book on the internet, well

01:27:36.490 --> 01:27:37.070
that's good.

01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:38.620
But people want more.

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:42.140
And we have to think about what the next stuff is.

01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:46.540
INTERVIEWER: So given that so much of this revolves around

01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:48.730
remote learning--

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.460
iLab or OpenCourseWare--

01:27:51.460 --> 01:27:55.890
what is the actual role of the physical location of the

01:27:55.890 --> 01:27:59.380
classroom and the class that gets together with a faculty

01:27:59.380 --> 01:28:02.990
member or an instructor going forward?

01:28:02.990 --> 01:28:03.330
ABELSON: Yeah.

01:28:03.330 --> 01:28:08.190
What an incredibly good question.

01:28:08.190 --> 01:28:08.600
Right.

01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:15.860
Because again on the one hand, there are some places in

01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:19.470
education, not the large lecture or anything, where you

01:28:19.470 --> 01:28:23.090
really, really, really want the sense of intimacy.

01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:27.850
I mean as much as you could ever want, you really have to

01:28:27.850 --> 01:28:30.780
be, I'm here for you.

01:28:30.780 --> 01:28:33.730
I'm here for you students and we're doing this thing.

01:28:33.730 --> 01:28:35.830
And we're engaged in this discussion right now.

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:41.200
And I don't want this stuff going outside the classroom

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:47.030
because what's happening with us right now is very special.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.890
I'm telling you things that we just don't--

01:28:50.890 --> 01:28:54.150
this is about us right now.

01:28:54.150 --> 01:28:56.150
And that's really, really important and will be

01:28:56.150 --> 01:28:58.410
important forever.

01:28:58.410 --> 01:29:03.250
The hard part is you have to ask yourself how much of that

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:06.380
sense of intimacy is technology now going to be

01:29:06.380 --> 01:29:09.130
able to supply?

01:29:09.130 --> 01:29:11.170
And we're going to be figuring this.

01:29:11.170 --> 01:29:15.220
Three years ago, it was a big deal to get on a video

01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.950
conference with somebody.

01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:20.610
And I do that with people across the world from my

01:29:20.610 --> 01:29:24.380
office and it's no more than sending a note saying hey, are

01:29:24.380 --> 01:29:25.340
you on Skype now?

01:29:25.340 --> 01:29:25.970
Let's connect.

01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:29.980
And we have a conversation.

01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:35.310
You have to ask yourself well, what are you losing by not

01:29:35.310 --> 01:29:38.230
being physically present there?

01:29:38.230 --> 01:29:40.670
And there's just a lot of research on that.

01:29:40.670 --> 01:29:42.140
They're all these shared

01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:44.950
conference spaces or something.

01:29:44.950 --> 01:29:49.160
I don't think people have done enough of thinking about that

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.590
with respect to education and seminars and things.

01:29:51.590 --> 01:29:53.660
But sure, people are going to try it.

01:29:53.660 --> 01:29:56.620
And we're going to find out.

01:29:56.620 --> 01:29:58.850
A lot of people feel like they're a little scared to go

01:29:58.850 --> 01:30:03.530
there because the implications of that is that maybe the

01:30:03.530 --> 01:30:08.690
physical thing doesn't matter for that.

01:30:08.690 --> 01:30:12.300
And then you say well, that wasn't the important part

01:30:12.300 --> 01:30:13.410
about the physical location.

01:30:13.410 --> 01:30:16.110
The important part about the physical location is that

01:30:16.110 --> 01:30:17.360
you're hanging around in the same place.

01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.860
There are all these serendipitous things that

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:22.270
happen, what do they call it, the water cooler effect.

01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:25.520
And that's the really important thing about having a

01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:27.360
physical location.

01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:29.770
And then you sort of say, well you know there are these

01:30:29.770 --> 01:30:31.370
people who are working on that too.

01:30:31.370 --> 01:30:34.780
And you have some stuff and you can counter people.

01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:36.340
There have been all these experiments with virtual

01:30:36.340 --> 01:30:40.100
worlds, which seem to had a lot more pizazz three years

01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:41.740
ago than they do now.

01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:43.820
But you're going to find technology being able to do

01:30:43.820 --> 01:30:46.130
pieces of that.

01:30:46.130 --> 01:30:49.010
And I don't know, we're going to find out which versions of

01:30:49.010 --> 01:30:50.050
that were important.

01:30:50.050 --> 01:30:54.260
We can all make up science fiction stories about how

01:30:54.260 --> 01:30:55.780
physical presence doesn't matter.

01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:58.760
But the point is for at least right now, physical presence

01:30:58.760 --> 01:31:00.930
matters a whole hell of a lot.

01:31:00.930 --> 01:31:04.600
And we'll sort of piece together the things that make

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.250
it work and are necessary and which can be supplanted.

01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:10.870
INTERVIEWER: So I want to return too to something that

01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:14.160
you said not too long ago about sort of that point when

01:31:14.160 --> 01:31:17.670
you started thinking about how MIT as an institution deals

01:31:17.670 --> 01:31:19.380
with these kinds of questions.

01:31:19.380 --> 01:31:23.580
And I guess my question is, given this very thorny

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:28.070
question that we were just discussing, how should MIT

01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.720
deal with that?

01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.970
How should MIT going forward, thinking about the next five,

01:31:31.970 --> 01:31:36.910
10, whatever years, deal with this very, very important

01:31:36.910 --> 01:31:41.380
question of the classroom versus remote learning?

01:31:41.380 --> 01:31:46.600
And is it technology driven, is it policy driven, is it a

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:47.850
combination?

01:31:47.850 --> 01:31:49.930


01:31:49.930 --> 01:31:51.860
ABELSON: I kind of want to say it's ethically driven.

01:31:51.860 --> 01:31:59.580
I really do feel that MIT has an almost ethical obligation

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:03.430
to say look, we are a precious resource.

01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:08.145
We understand about learning and technology and things.

01:32:08.145 --> 01:32:11.536


01:32:11.536 --> 01:32:13.080
I hate to sound maudlin.

01:32:13.080 --> 01:32:17.450
We have an obligation to humanity to make that better.

01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:22.260
And what's the way in which MIT can be an exemplar of that

01:32:22.260 --> 01:32:24.950
and a model of that?

01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:30.530
And it means that when you think about what we should do

01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:35.830
in educational technology at MIT, you really are thinking

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:39.340
that you're a model for the rest of the world.

01:32:39.340 --> 01:32:43.280
And how would you like that to happen?

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.820
How would you like to play out?

01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:53.130
When we do something great in a classroom, we are obligated

01:32:53.130 --> 01:32:56.770
to say how can other people follow that or how could other

01:32:56.770 --> 01:32:59.260
people think about whether it's a good thing to do.

01:32:59.260 --> 01:33:02.720
It's not just about MIT.

01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:06.930
It's a world resource that those of us who are teaching

01:33:06.930 --> 01:33:09.050
are just privileged to be part of.

01:33:09.050 --> 01:33:13.500
And that privilege is not only about MIT undergraduate body.

01:33:13.500 --> 01:33:16.730
It's about how the world is going to look at it.

01:33:16.730 --> 01:33:22.720
So that doesn't tell you what to do but it's the sense of

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.720
obligation that you feel in doing that, that it's not just

01:33:27.720 --> 01:33:28.460
looking inward.

01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:33.070
There are places that are not like that at all.

01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:36.650
I mean Harvard by and large is not like that.

01:33:36.650 --> 01:33:40.070
But MIT is the sense of god, we're doing it for the world.

01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:43.560
And that's how I think about the institutional thing when

01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:44.810
we do educational technology.

01:33:44.810 --> 01:33:48.350


01:33:48.350 --> 01:33:51.270
INTERVIEWER: This isn't about the classroom specifically,

01:33:51.270 --> 01:33:53.510
but it very much relates to what you just said.

01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:57.420
I wanted to ask you about the open access policy.

01:33:57.420 --> 01:33:58.670
ABELSON: Oh, right.

01:33:58.670 --> 01:34:00.910


01:34:00.910 --> 01:34:04.130
That threads through lots and lots and lots of this.

01:34:04.130 --> 01:34:05.450
I talked before about DSpace.

01:34:05.450 --> 01:34:10.060
So that's open access.

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:11.710
I'm also one of the founding directors for the Free

01:34:11.710 --> 01:34:14.990
Software Foundation, which is--

01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:19.190
again growth, we talked before about the AI Lab culture.

01:34:19.190 --> 01:34:20.520
It grows right out of that.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:23.524
That it's about a community thing.

01:34:23.524 --> 01:34:32.170
And the precious thing is that you allow people to build on

01:34:32.170 --> 01:34:34.470
each other's work.

01:34:34.470 --> 01:34:37.420
So a lot of times when people talk about open access, they

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:41.000
say gee, I ought to be able to read some stuff on the

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.790
internet or be able to do stuff or it's locked away and

01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:47.110
I shouldn't have to pay to get it.

01:34:47.110 --> 01:34:50.600
That's not the spirit, that's not the soul of it.

01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:55.750
The soul of it is that we can build a shared thing together.

01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:59.430
I always use the metaphor of there was this thing that

01:34:59.430 --> 01:35:03.090
happened in the Middle Ages where the whole town together

01:35:03.090 --> 01:35:06.100
got and built the cathedral.

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:10.800
And I sort of think about the information environment as the

01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:14.080
opportunity to make that kind of cathedral.

01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:20.170
That humanity as a whole gets smarter because we can rebuild

01:35:20.170 --> 01:35:21.270
what each others are doing.

01:35:21.270 --> 01:35:22.170
And we can build on it.

01:35:22.170 --> 01:35:24.430
So that's for me, what open access is about.

01:35:24.430 --> 01:35:25.730
That's what OpenCourseWare is about.

01:35:25.730 --> 01:35:30.280
So it's critical if you look at the license behind

01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:35.490
OpenCourseWare or free software, any of it.

01:35:35.490 --> 01:35:40.130
One of it is that people get to use it how they want.

01:35:40.130 --> 01:35:45.440
But the other is that people get to modify and we republish

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.480
it and make it better and improve.

01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:50.980
So for me that's just central to what

01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:52.030
people call open access.

01:35:52.030 --> 01:35:59.480
Open access is in some sense a bad word because it doesn't

01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:01.610
have this sense of building on each other's work.

01:36:01.610 --> 01:36:04.470
I'm sort of playing with this new slogan that I want to call

01:36:04.470 --> 01:36:07.450
the remixed university.

01:36:07.450 --> 01:36:09.520
That's the stage after just the open university.

01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:10.800
It's not so interesting.

01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:14.300
I can go look at the classes that MIT teaches.

01:36:14.300 --> 01:36:17.660
It's can that be a thing from which I can build even better

01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:19.870
stuff than MIT is doing.

01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:25.150
And that to me is just a central meme in how I hope the

01:36:25.150 --> 01:36:26.560
internet continues to go.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.900
The internet started a lot of that.

01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:30.160
Much of it's being threatened.

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.477
But I think part of it is demonstrating to people the

01:36:33.477 --> 01:36:36.150
value of that.

01:36:36.150 --> 01:36:40.110
INTERVIEWER: So in talking or thinking a bit about your work

01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:45.550
in protecting the intellectual commons, you mentioned the

01:36:45.550 --> 01:36:47.430
Free Software Foundation, which is definitely something

01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:50.030
that I wanted to talk to you about.

01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:53.720
Tell me about Creative Commons, another I think

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.860
important part of this.

01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:56.530
ABELSON: Right.

01:36:56.530 --> 01:37:01.000
There was this magical couple years where we started DSpace,

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.360
we started OpenCourseWare, we showed Creative Commons, right

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:10.160
around 2000.

01:37:10.160 --> 01:37:14.630
So I had the tremendous fortune of actually working

01:37:14.630 --> 01:37:15.320
with Larry Lessig.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:19.090
We tried a joint course between Harvard and MIT when

01:37:19.090 --> 01:37:23.340
he was formulating these ideas about open culture and things.

01:37:23.340 --> 01:37:28.210
And Creative Commons kind of started in a couple of

01:37:28.210 --> 01:37:31.600
discussions, the sense of should there be something

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.430
about sharing and commons that could happen in

01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:36.550
terms of law or policy?

01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:39.910


01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:45.590
Larry had just recently unsuccessfully argued Eldred

01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:47.540
v. Ashcroft before the Supreme Court.

01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:50.680
So that was when Congress extended copyright

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.135
by another 20 years.

01:37:52.135 --> 01:37:53.850
And that came up to the Supreme Court.

01:37:53.850 --> 01:37:59.380
And Larry argued at the Supreme Court and he lost.

01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:02.250
The Supreme Court basically said well, you may have shown that

01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:04.020
this is a bad idea to extend copyright.

01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:05.530
But by the way, it's Congress that makes the

01:38:05.530 --> 01:38:07.270
copyright law, not us.

01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:13.460
And Larry was looking for some constructive reaction to that.

01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:18.550
I was thinking about some kind of way of rewarding people

01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:21.170
effectively for putting things into the public domain.

01:38:21.170 --> 01:38:25.240
What could you do by policy to stimulate

01:38:25.240 --> 01:38:26.320
that kind of sharing?

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.570
We talked about that.

01:38:27.570 --> 01:38:30.340


01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:31.810
Larry found some funding.

01:38:31.810 --> 01:38:35.370
And we got this idea of Creative Commons.

01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:37.710
There were small group of about, I want to

01:38:37.710 --> 01:38:40.520
say about 10 of us.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:45.280
And sort of said gee, what we want to do is in the phrase,

01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:47.530
brand the public domain.

01:38:47.530 --> 01:38:51.410
We wanted people to be aware that the shared stuff that you

01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:56.080
can use and reuse was not sort of the detritus.

01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.990
The law in the US talks about abandoning something to the

01:38:58.990 --> 01:38:59.910
public domain.

01:38:59.910 --> 01:39:02.310
It was not sort of this invisible stuff.

01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:04.790
One of the things you can do on the internet is you can

01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:08.910
actually give that an identity and make people aware of it.

01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:11.530
That was the soul of Creative Commons.

01:39:11.530 --> 01:39:15.290
And then it kind of linked into some stuff that I'd been

01:39:15.290 --> 01:39:19.040
doing with the Web Consortium that said oh by the way, one

01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:22.290
of the things you might want to do if you're going to make

01:39:22.290 --> 01:39:25.610
licenses crafted to that, you want to make those licenses

01:39:25.610 --> 01:39:29.280
machine readable so machines can

01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:31.120
identify that on the internet.

01:39:31.120 --> 01:39:32.550
So that's the start of Creative Commons.

01:39:32.550 --> 01:39:34.830
And that program is sort of still going ahead.

01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:36.340
It's got a long, long, long way to go.

01:39:36.340 --> 01:39:40.490


01:39:40.490 --> 01:39:44.310
I remember we were sitting around and saying well, what

01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:45.560
would be success?

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:47.680


01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:50.640
How many things do you think should have these licenses?

01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.805
So I'm always the poor non-visionary.

01:39:53.805 --> 01:39:54.490
Right.

01:39:54.490 --> 01:39:57.530
And I said, gosh if we got a couple of million of things on

01:39:57.530 --> 01:39:59.000
the net with the Creative Commons, that

01:39:59.000 --> 01:39:59.820
would be really good.

01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:02.520
And Larry said well, I actually think all of it

01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:04.360
should be Creative Commons.

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.220
And then we seem to have compromised.

01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:09.540
Now there's about 200 million Creative Commons

01:40:09.540 --> 01:40:11.130
documents on the net.

01:40:11.130 --> 01:40:13.310
So it will also hit a meme and expand it.

01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:16.840
And by the way, had a lot to do with OpenCourseWare.

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:22.690
So I was very active in the start up of both of those.

01:40:22.690 --> 01:40:28.340
And from the point of view of Creative Commons, MIT was the

01:40:28.340 --> 01:40:32.180
first sort of big, important place to adopt Creative

01:40:32.180 --> 01:40:34.140
Commons licenses.

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:38.520
And from the point of view of OpenCourseWare, we wanted

01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:42.760
there to be a lot of freely licensed stuff on the web.

01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:49.300
So in particular when I put up my lectures on OpenCourseWare

01:40:49.300 --> 01:40:51.790
and I want to put some illustrations into my lecture,

01:40:51.790 --> 01:40:53.870
there's a lot of Creative Commons licensed stuff that I

01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:55.350
could just use.

01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:58.895
So that program still hasn't unfolded a lot.

01:40:58.895 --> 01:41:00.010
But it was very consciously--

01:41:00.010 --> 01:41:01.390
at least I thought about it.

01:41:01.390 --> 01:41:04.620
I was working on those two things together.

01:41:04.620 --> 01:41:08.450
INTERVIEWER: You mentioned that open access or the

01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:10.660
intellectual commons is under threat.

01:41:10.660 --> 01:41:15.740
Can you talk a bit about that, the current environment now as

01:41:15.740 --> 01:41:18.790
opposed to when you were pioneering all of this?

01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:21.420
ABELSON: Well like I said, we've gone from the stage of

01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:23.940
they ignore us to the stage where they laugh at us to the

01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.600
stage where they are actually fighting us.

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:32.290


01:41:32.290 --> 01:41:35.820
The rhetoric in Congress now is we're

01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:38.000
stealing all of this stuff.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:41.550
Everybody is stealing stuff on the internet, that why don't

01:41:41.550 --> 01:41:44.700
you pay for it?

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:49.560
Gosh, the US economy depend so much on intellectual property

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:51.980
and exporting that, we have to protect the

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:53.720
stuff on the network.

01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:58.790
And the whole rhetoric is completely dominated by that.

01:41:58.790 --> 01:42:02.060
I mean part of the problem is that Creative Common sounds a

01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:05.680
lot like communist. So everyone says gosh, you guys

01:42:05.680 --> 01:42:07.420
are a bunch of communists.

01:42:07.420 --> 01:42:08.810
You want to steal our stuff.

01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:11.770


01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:15.880
Oh my god, there was an article when Creative Commons

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:22.030
was first starting up, in was it Billboard, which talked

01:42:22.030 --> 01:42:27.050
about gosh, there is this young composer who puts his

01:42:27.050 --> 01:42:29.910
music up on a Creative Commons thing.

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:32.580
And this turned out to be a great hit.

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:35.710
And now he can't get any monetary value to it because

01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:36.530
he gave it away.

01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:40.990
And he's dying of AIDS and can't pay for the medication

01:42:40.990 --> 01:42:41.880
that he needs.

01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.940
And you Creative Commons people are the ones who is

01:42:44.940 --> 01:42:48.810
responsible for this guy dying of AIDS.

01:42:48.810 --> 01:42:52.940
And there's this whole rhetoric that's around it,

01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:57.201
because people are starting to see that it's getting serious.

01:42:57.201 --> 01:43:02.770
And you have a lot of business models that are simply based

01:43:02.770 --> 01:43:05.080
on the fact that you could control the

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:06.330
distribution channels.

01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:10.430


01:43:10.430 --> 01:43:14.560
So a lot of people think that those of us in Creative

01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:20.170
Commons are against copyright and against commercialism.

01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:22.070
And that's just not true.

01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:25.200
I mean Creative Commons is built in copyright.

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:29.680
And the thing that I think is bad is not that people are

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:34.340
making money, it's that they're exerting over-control.

01:43:34.340 --> 01:43:38.630
So if there is a way to, without exerting that kind of

01:43:38.630 --> 01:43:43.400
control, realize money from this stuff, well great.

01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:47.745
I mean I love it if people say gee, we've got a business and

01:43:47.745 --> 01:43:49.140
it's working on Creative Commons stuff.

01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:51.760
But maybe it's a service business.

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:56.880
Or maybe it's an advising kind of business or maybe it's some

01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:02.250
other spin where you use the free material to bolster the

01:44:02.250 --> 01:44:05.280
fact that you're providing other stuff of value.

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:08.560
And I think that's where this stuff needs to go.

01:44:08.560 --> 01:44:13.890
But the particular thing that works is very sensitive to the

01:44:13.890 --> 01:44:16.320
state of technology of the web.

01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:20.530
And that's evolving very, very fast. And it's just sort of

01:44:20.530 --> 01:44:23.470
exploring more, exploring more business models.

01:44:23.470 --> 01:44:25.870
But when I said people are fighting it, by and large

01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:28.990
you're seeing people in the old business models who of

01:44:28.990 --> 01:44:33.540
course are established, who of course have stories that

01:44:33.540 --> 01:44:36.350
Congress understands.

01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:39.930
So it's always hard when you're trying to make policy

01:44:39.930 --> 01:44:41.770
and you have a vision of what could be.

01:44:41.770 --> 01:44:44.380


01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:47.820
A vision of what could be is never powerful compared to a

01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.380
vision of what is.

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:53.270
And it just takes a long time.

01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:57.550
INTERVIEWER: So in moving towards wrapping up just a

01:44:57.550 --> 01:45:04.710
bit, in these two related but somewhat differing areas of

01:45:04.710 --> 01:45:08.110
open networks, open access, and educational technology

01:45:08.110 --> 01:45:12.770
with a focus on this whole question of the remoteness or

01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:18.220
the locality of education, MIT has been obviously

01:45:18.220 --> 01:45:22.630
historically a leader in both of those areas, if you think

01:45:22.630 --> 01:45:26.370
about OpenCourseWare as one example of many.

01:45:26.370 --> 01:45:31.360
What should MIT be doing looking ahead to continue to

01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:37.030
lead and be ethical as you said?

01:45:37.030 --> 01:45:38.940
I mean are there things that MIT is not doing that it

01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:41.160
should be doing or that it is doing that it

01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.410
should continue to do?

01:45:42.410 --> 01:45:44.910


01:45:44.910 --> 01:45:48.000
ABELSON: So one of the things that MIT is not doing, and I'm

01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:55.360
not sure why not, is we are currently making a lot of

01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.420
partnerships with institutions around the world, which I

01:45:58.420 --> 01:46:00.430
think is fantastic.

01:46:00.430 --> 01:46:04.520
But too often there is no educational piece in those

01:46:04.520 --> 01:46:07.050
partnerships.

01:46:07.050 --> 01:46:11.430
So we talk about MIT's association with some research

01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:16.290
institute and partly because of what these other places

01:46:16.290 --> 01:46:20.030
want from MIT and whether they view MIT, they sort of say

01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:23.550
this is a great research partnership.

01:46:23.550 --> 01:46:27.410
And one of the things MIT needs to be insisting on is

01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:31.330
what's the place of students and undergraduates in that

01:46:31.330 --> 01:46:32.390
kind of partnership?

01:46:32.390 --> 01:46:38.340
MIT needs to say as part of leading the world, we deeply

01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:44.170
believe that what makes an institution like MIT work is

01:46:44.170 --> 01:46:47.200
the integration of research and education.

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:49.840
MIT is not saying that strongly enough.

01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.580
And I think that's another place where MIT needs to lead.

01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:56.870
It's saying how do you become a great institution?

01:46:56.870 --> 01:47:00.180


01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:03.660
It's not only a good idea to be involved in education, but

01:47:03.660 --> 01:47:07.300
it's integral to what makes the place successful.

01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:09.590
So there's a thing MIT is not doing right now, that I really

01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:12.780
wish it were going more.

01:47:12.780 --> 01:47:17.680
The other thing that I'm personally working on with the

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:24.430
Educational Technology Council and with the provosts is this

01:47:24.430 --> 01:47:30.200
notion of opening the walls of the university in the sense

01:47:30.200 --> 01:47:37.060
that it's not merely let's say the OpenCourseWare vision or

01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:41.655
the DSpace vision that says MIT puts stuff out that allows

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:44.480
the world to participate.

01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:48.610
It's that there's a way of taking stuff in.

01:47:48.610 --> 01:47:53.000
What role in terms of educational resources do our

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.662
alumni play?

01:47:54.662 --> 01:48:00.550
If you take the combined MIT alumni, which are what now,

01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:06.740
80,000, 90,000, you have a considerable fraction of the

01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:10.580
technological power of the world.

01:48:10.580 --> 01:48:14.020
How does MIT use that as a research for improving our

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:19.630
education and again creating a model of how top technology

01:48:19.630 --> 01:48:22.760
people can contribute to institutions in the world.

01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:25.020
MIT is not doing that enough.

01:48:25.020 --> 01:48:29.220
That's a little bit of what we're trying to work on now.

01:48:29.220 --> 01:48:34.100
In a world where, oh some university I want to mention

01:48:34.100 --> 01:48:41.150
and say we could teach calculus to 50,000 people in

01:48:41.150 --> 01:48:47.660
some foreign country, how do we use technology to allow our

01:48:47.660 --> 01:48:50.300
undergraduates to have tremendously good

01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:52.930
international experiences, while

01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:55.025
taking some MIT calculus?

01:48:55.025 --> 01:48:59.730
Are there ways we can translate little pieces of MIT

01:48:59.730 --> 01:49:04.170
so that MIT students can have some of these experiences

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:08.360
without feeling that they have to blow off

01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.040
courses for a semester?

01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:12.370
The mechanical engineering department talks about

01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:15.820
wouldn't it be great if students in mechanical

01:49:15.820 --> 01:49:18.300
engineering could take two weeks off and go build cars

01:49:18.300 --> 01:49:21.000
and race them on the Isle of White.

01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.400
How do we make that possible?

01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:29.580
So that's a direction where I think MIT needs to go.

01:49:29.580 --> 01:49:33.370
I said there's this buzz word, the remixed university.

01:49:33.370 --> 01:49:36.870
How do we make that possible and how does MIT lead in

01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:38.310
showing how you can make that possible?

01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:41.940


01:49:41.940 --> 01:49:43.580
INTERVIEWER: I mean MIT obviously is a place with

01:49:43.580 --> 01:49:48.440
tremendous technical technological expertise.

01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:51.030
But our conversation has ranged over all sorts of

01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:55.520
topics that go beyond simple technology, policy issues,

01:49:55.520 --> 01:49:57.690
just how we live our lives in the world.

01:49:57.690 --> 01:50:02.560
And I'm wondering if you could talk a bit about what special

01:50:02.560 --> 01:50:06.430
or particular role technologists, engineers

01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:11.410
should or could play in those broader ethical,

01:50:11.410 --> 01:50:13.510
philosophical, policy kinds of questions?

01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:17.540


01:50:17.540 --> 01:50:22.830
ABELSON: Well, part is the easy thing about just knowing

01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:26.460
the consequences or the likely consequences of certain kinds

01:50:26.460 --> 01:50:28.580
of investments or policies.

01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:33.170
And I don't think anybody will argue that engineers and

01:50:33.170 --> 01:50:37.360
scientists should speak up about that.

01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:41.960
But I think beyond that there's this sense of actually

01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:45.970
making things, which I do think is very special to

01:50:45.970 --> 01:50:47.220
engineering.

01:50:47.220 --> 01:50:51.110


01:50:51.110 --> 01:50:54.010
It's really find to talk about things and to discuss, and

01:50:54.010 --> 01:50:57.770
discuss, and discuss, but at the end of the day you have to

01:50:57.770 --> 01:51:01.720
have some effect and some kind of impact.

01:51:01.720 --> 01:51:06.380
And engineers are great in doing things.

01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:08.650
It's not always right.

01:51:08.650 --> 01:51:12.410
But there's this notion of you kind of have to put it on the

01:51:12.410 --> 01:51:15.330
line and make something.

01:51:15.330 --> 01:51:21.550
And that's part of what it means to, I want to say

01:51:21.550 --> 01:51:24.350
participate in the discussion of how the world should be.

01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:27.190
You come in and you actually think about how to make it.

01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:27.680
And you try it.

01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:29.090
And you never get it right the first time.

01:51:29.090 --> 01:51:30.660
And then you make it better.

01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:37.150
And there needs to be that sense of instrumentality.

01:51:37.150 --> 01:51:39.330
And that's what I think a place like MIT and a place

01:51:39.330 --> 01:51:42.850
like engineering cultures can add to these discussions.

01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:46.070
And there needs to be a whole lot more of that.

01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:47.620
INTERVIEWER: Is there anything that you haven't had a chance

01:51:47.620 --> 01:51:52.880
to talk about that we should have touched on as we're

01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:55.690
wrapping up.

01:51:55.690 --> 01:52:05.270
ABELSON: Well no, other than I'm constantly humbled and

01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:07.835
amazed and charged by just the privilege of being in

01:52:07.835 --> 01:52:09.730
a place like MIT.

01:52:09.730 --> 01:52:13.030
I mean everybody talks about what a unique place it is.

01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:17.220
But there's just this personal sense of how in hell did I

01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:20.660
ever end up here, interacting with this group of people?

01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:23.180
So I drive in from Newton every morning.

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:25.475
And there's this place where you drive up Commonwealth

01:52:25.475 --> 01:52:28.640
Avenue and then you sort of turn and

01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.595
go over the BU Bridge.

01:52:29.595 --> 01:52:31.640
And the BU Bridge sort of looks like this gateway thing.

01:52:31.640 --> 01:52:34.300
And I say, I can't believe it.

01:52:34.300 --> 01:52:37.525
It's almost every day, after so many years, I say oh my

01:52:37.525 --> 01:52:41.360
god, I'm coming to MIT.

01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:43.790
How did I manage to do this?

01:52:43.790 --> 01:52:48.350
How did I get so lucky as to be in a place like this, just

01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:50.590
surrounded by all of these brilliant people and all of

01:52:50.590 --> 01:52:51.840
these incredible students?

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:54.845


01:52:54.845 --> 01:52:55.290
INTERVIEWER: Okay.

01:52:55.290 --> 01:52:56.370
Well, thanks so much Hal.

01:52:56.370 --> 01:52:58.350
I really appreciate you taking the time to talk to us.

01:52:58.350 --> 01:52:58.460
ABELSON: Sure.

01:52:58.460 --> 01:52:58.625
INTERVIEWER: It was wonderful.

01:52:58.625 --> 01:52:59.930
Thank you.

01:52:59.930 --> 01:53:03.918
