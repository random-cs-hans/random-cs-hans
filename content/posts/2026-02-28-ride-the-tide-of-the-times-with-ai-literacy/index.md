How does an innovation ecosystem take shape? Looking back at history, certain skills have proven crucial for the next generation: in the 15th century, children proficient in literacy were the "friends of their era"; by the end of the 20th century, children adept with computers—like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and others—were the "friends of their era". Today, children who can skillfully use AI tools are moving in step with the times.

Looking ahead, I believe that open-source will enable freedom of knowledge, large models will enable freedom of capability, and IPv6 will enable freedom of connectivity. Notably, IPv6 technologies—especially the interoperability with IPv4—have matured, large model technologies are becoming increasingly refined, and China is leading the global open-source ecosystem. The combination of these three factors may profoundly transform the world.

To achieve this transformation, we must first nurture our cultural DNA. In the future era of networked large models, everyone may become a CEO, a SME owner. Each individual may possess their own large models and numerous intelligent agents. A new approach to general education should be dedicated to fostering an entrepreneurial mindset in the next generation. In this regard, the Yangtze River Delta region holds significant "genetic" advantages. We need to establish a mechanism that incentivizes social contribution through self-interest, so that people can collaborate to improve their lives and set new trends.

——Excerpt from the speech by Li Xing, Professor at the Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, at the 2025 Digital Yangtze River Delta Development Conference
